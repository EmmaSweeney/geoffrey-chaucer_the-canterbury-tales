				<p>
					<span>When folk had laughed all at this nice case</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Absolon and Hendy Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Diverse folk diversely they said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the more part they laugh’d and play’d;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at this tale I saw no man him grieve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it were only Osewold the Reeve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because he was of carpenteres craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little ire is in his hearte laft;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gan to grudge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and blamed it a lite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So the I,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> quoth he, “full well could I him quite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With blearing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> of a proude miller’s eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that me list to speak of ribaldry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I am old; me list not play for age;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grass time is done, my fodder is now forage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This white top<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> writeth mine olde years;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine heart is also moulded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> as mine hairs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I do fare as doth an open-erse;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> fruit is ever longer werse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it be rotten in mullok or in stre.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>We olde men, I dread, so fare we;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till we be rotten, can we not be ripe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We hop<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> away, while that the world will pipe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in our will there sticketh aye a nail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have an hoary head and a green tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As hath a leek; for though our might be gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our will desireth folly ever-in-one:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when we may not do, then will we speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet in our ashes cold does fire reek.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Four gledes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> have we, which I shall devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vaunting, and lying, anger, covetise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These foure sparks belongen unto eld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our olde limbes well may be unweld,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">39</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But will shall never fail us, that is sooth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet have I alway a coltes tooth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">40</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As many a year as it is passed and gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that my tap of life began to run;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sickerly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> when I was born, anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death drew the tap of life, and let it gon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever since hath so the tap y-run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that almost all empty is the tun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stream of life now droppeth on the chimb.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silly tongue well may ring and chime</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wretchedness, that passed is full yore:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With olde folk, save dotage, is no more.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When that our Host had heard this sermoning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gan to speak as lordly as a king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “To what amounteth all this wit?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? shall we speak all day of holy writ?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil made a Reeve for to preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of a souter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> a shipman, or a leach.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say forth thy tale, and tarry not the time:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo here is Deptford, and ’tis half past prime:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo Greenwich, where many a shrew is in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It were high time thy tale to begin.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now, sirs,” quoth then this Osewold the Reeve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you all that none of you do grieve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I answer, and somewhat set his hove,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For lawful is force off with force to shove.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This drunken miller hath y-told us here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that beguiled was a carpentere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paraventure in scorn, for I am one:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, by your leave, I shall him quite anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right in his churlish termes will I speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God his necke might to-break.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can well in mine eye see a stalk,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in his own he cannot see a balk.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></h3>
				<p>
					<span>At Trompington, not far from Cantebrig,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There goes a brook, and over that a brig,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the whiche brook there stands a mill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this is very sooth that I you tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A miller was there dwelling many a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any peacock he was proud and gay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pipen he could, and fish, and nettes bete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turne cups, and wrestle well, and shete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aye by his belt he bare a long pavade,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his sword full trenchant was the blade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A jolly popper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> bare he in his pouch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no man for peril durst him touch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Sheffield whittle bare he in his hose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round was his face, and camuse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> was his nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As pilled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> as an ape’s was his skull.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was a market-beter at the full.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There durste no wight hand upon him legge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he ne swore anon he should abegge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A thief he was, for sooth, of corn and meal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that a sly, and used well to steal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His name was hoten deinous Simekin.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife he hadde, come of noble kin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parson of the town her father was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her he gave full many a pan of brass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that Simkin should in his blood ally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was y-foster’d in a nunnery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Simkin woulde no wife, as he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she were well y-nourish’d, and a maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To saven his estate and yeomanry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she was proud, and pert as is a pie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A full fair sight it was to see them two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On holy days before her would he go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his tippet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> y-bound about his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she came after in a gite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> of red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Simkin hadde hosen of the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There durste no wight call her aught but Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None was so hardy, walking by that way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with her either durste rage or play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> he would be slain by Simekin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With pavade, or with knife, or bodekin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For jealous folk be per’lous evermo’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> they would their wives wende so.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke for she was somewhat smutterlich,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was as dign<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> as water in a ditch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all so full of hoker,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and bismare.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her thoughte that a lady should her spare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What for her kindred, and her nortelrie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she had learned in the nunnery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One daughter hadde they betwixt them two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of twenty year, withouten any mo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saving a child that was of half year age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In cradle it lay, and was a proper page.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wenche thick and well y-growen was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With camuse nose, and eyen gray as glass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With buttocks broad, and breastes round and high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But right fair was her hair, I will not lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parson of the town, for she was fair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In purpose was to make of her his heir</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of his chattels and his messuage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strange he made it of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a> her marriage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His purpose was for to bestow her high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into some worthy blood of ancestry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For holy Church’s good may be dispended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On holy Church’s blood that is descended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore he would his holy blood honour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he holy Churche should devour.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great soken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> hath this miller, out of doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wheat and malt, of all the land about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> there was a great college</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men call the Soler Hall at Cantebrege,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a day it happed in a stound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sick lay the manciple<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> of a malady,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men weened wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> that he shoulde die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which this miller stole both meal and corn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An hundred times more than beforn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For theretofore he stole but courteously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now he was a thief outrageously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which the warden chid and made fare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thereof set the miller not a tare;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He crack’d his boast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and swore it was not so.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then were there younge poore scholars two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dwelled in the hall of which I say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Testif<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> they were, and lusty for to play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And only for their mirth and revelry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the warden busily they cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give them leave for but a little stound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To go to mill, and see their corn y-ground:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hardily<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> they durste lay their neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller should not steal them half a peck</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of corn by sleight, nor them by force bereave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last the warden give them leave:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>John hight the one, and Alein hight the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of one town were they born, that highte Strother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far in the North, I cannot tell you where.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Alein he made ready all his gear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a horse the sack he cast anon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth went Alein the clerk, and also John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With good sword and with buckler by their side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>John knew the way, him needed not no guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the mill the sack adown he lay’th.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alein spake first; “All hail, Simon, in faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How fares thy faire daughter, and thy wife.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alein, welcome,” quoth Simkin, “by my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And John also: how now, what do ye here?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God, Simon,” quoth John, “need has no peer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him serve himself behoves that has no swain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our manciple I hope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> he will be dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So workes aye the wanges<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> in his head:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore is I come, and eke Alein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To grind our corn and carry it home again:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you speed us hence as well ye may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It shall be done,” quoth Simkin, “by my fay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What will ye do while that it is in hand?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God, right by the hopper will I stand,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth John, “and see how that the corn goes in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet saw I never, by my father’s kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that the hopper wagges to and fro.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein answered, “John, and wilt thou so?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will I be beneathe, by my crown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And see how that the meale falls adown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the trough, that shall be my disport:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, John, in faith I may be of your sort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I is as ill a miller as is ye.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This miller smiled at their nicety,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “All this is done but for a wile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They weenen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> that no man may them beguile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by my thrift yet shall I blear their eye,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the sleight in their philosophy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more quainte knackes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> that they make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more will I steal when that I take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Instead of flour yet will I give them bren.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all their art ne count I not a tare.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out at the door he went full privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he saw his time, softely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looked up and down, until he found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clerkes’ horse, there as he stood y-bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind the mill, under a levesell:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the horse he went him fair and well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stripped off the bridle right anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the horse was loose, he gan to gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the fen, where wilde mares run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth, with “Wehee!” through thick and eke through thin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This miller went again, no word he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But did his note,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> and with these clerkes play’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that their corn was fair and well y-ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the meal was sacked and y-bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then John went out, and found his horse away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan to cry, “Harow, and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our horse is lost: Alein, for Godde’s bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Step on thy feet; come off, man, all at once:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! our warden has his palfrey lorn.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Alein all forgot, both meal and corn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All was out of his mind his husbandry.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, which way is he gone?” he gan to cry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wife came leaping inward at a renne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She said; “Alas! your horse went to the fen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wilde mares, as fast as he could go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unthank<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> come on his hand that bound him so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his that better should have knit the rein.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth John, “Alein, for Christes pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay down thy sword, and I shall mine also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I is full wight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> God wate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> as is a roe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Godde’s soul he shall not scape us bathe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why n’ had thou put the capel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> in the lathe?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ill hail, Alein, by God thou is a fonne.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These silly clerkes have full fast y-run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the fen, both Alein and eke John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the miller saw that they were gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He half a bushel of their flour did take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade his wife go knead it in a cake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said; I trow, the clerkes were afeard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet can a miller make a clerkes beard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all his art: yea, let them go their way!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo where they go! yea, let the children play:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They get him not so lightly, by my crown.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These silly clerkes runnen up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With “Keep, keep; stand, stand; jossa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> warderere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go whistle thou, and I shall keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> him here.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But shortly, till that it was very night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They coulde not, though they did all their might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their capel catch, he ran alway so fast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till in a ditch they caught him at the last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Weary and wet, as beastes in the rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comes silly John, and with him comes Alein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas,” quoth John, “the day that I was born!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now are we driv’n till hething<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and till scorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our corn is stol’n, men will us fonnes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both the warden, and eke our fellows all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> the miller, well-away!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus plained John, as he went by the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the mill, and Bayard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> in his hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller sitting by the fire he fand.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it was night, and forther<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> might they not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the love of God they him besought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of herberow and ease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> for their penny.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller said again,” If there be any,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as it is, yet shall ye have your part.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine house is strait, but ye have learned art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye can by arguments maken a place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mile broad, of twenty foot of space.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let see now if this place may suffice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or make it room with speech, as is your guise.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Simon,” said this John, “by Saint Cuthberd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aye is thou merry, and that is fair answer’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have heard say, man shall take of two things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as he findes, or such as he brings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But specially I pray thee, hoste dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> us have meat and drink, and make us cheer,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With empty hand men may not hawkes tull.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo here our silver ready for to spend.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This miller to the town his daughter send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bound their horse, he should no more go loose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And them in his own chamber made a bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sheetes and with chalons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> fair y-spread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not from his owen bed ten foot or twelve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His daughter had a bed all by herselve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right in the same chamber by and by:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It might no better be, and cause why,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no roomer herberow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They suppen, and they speaken of solace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drinken ever strong ale at the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboute midnight went they all to rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well had this miller varnished his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full pale he was, fordrunken, and nought red.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He yoxed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and he spake thorough the nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he were in the quakke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> or in the pose.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bed he went, and with him went his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any jay she light was and jolife,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was her jolly whistle well y-wet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cradle at her beddes feet was set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rock, and eke to give the child to suck.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that drunken was all in the crock<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bedde went the daughter right anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bedde went Alein, and also John.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no more; needed them no dwale.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This miller had, so wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> bibbed ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as a horse he snorted in his sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor of his tail behind he took no keep.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife bare him a burdoun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> a full strong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men might their routing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> hearen a furlong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The wenche routed eke for company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein the clerk, that heard this melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He poked John, and saide: “Sleepest thou?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heardest thou ever such a song ere now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo what a compline<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a> is y-mell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> them all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wilde fire upon their bodies fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who hearken’d ever such a ferly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a> thing?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, they shall have the flow’r of ill ending!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This longe night there tides<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a> me no rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet no force,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">39</a> all shall be for the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, John,” said he, “as ever may I thrive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that I may, yon wenche will I swive.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">40</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some easement has law y-shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">41</a> us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, John, there is a law that sayeth thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if a man in one point be aggriev’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in another he shall be relievd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our corn is stol’n, soothly it is no nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we have had an evil fit to-day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since I shall have none amendement</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against my loss, I will have easement:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Godde’s soul, it shall none, other be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This John answer’d; Alein, avise thee:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller is a perilous man,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And if that he out of his sleep abraid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mighte do us both a villainy.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein answer’d; “I count him not a fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up he rose, and by the wench he crept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wenche lay upright, and fast she slept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he so nigh was, ere she might espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it had been too late for to cry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, shortly for to say, they were at one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now play, Alein, for I will speak of John.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This John lay still a furlong way or two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to himself he made ruth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> and woe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “this is a wicked jape;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may I say, that I is but an ape.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet has my fellow somewhat for his harm;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He has the miller’s daughter in his arm:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He auntred<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> him, and hath his needes sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I lie as a draff-sack in my bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this jape is told another day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall be held a daffe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> or a cockenay:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will arise, and auntre it, by my fay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unhardy is unsely,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> as men say.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up he rose, and softely he went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the cradle, and in his hand it hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bare it soft unto his beddes feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon after this the wife her routing lete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan awake, and went her out to piss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came again and gan the cradle miss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And groped here and there, but she found none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth she, “I had almost misgone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had almost gone to the clerkes’ bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ey! <i>Benedicite</i>, then had I foul y-sped.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth she went, till she the cradle fand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She groped alway farther with her hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found the bed, and thoughte not but good,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that the cradle by it stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wist not where she was, for it was derk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fair and well she crept in by the clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lay full still, and would have caught a sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within a while this John the Clerk up leap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on this goode wife laid on full sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So merry a fit had she not had full yore.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He pricked hard and deep, as he were mad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This jolly life have these two clerkes had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that the thirde cock began to sing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein wax’d weary in the morrowing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had swonken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> all the longe night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; “Farewell, Malkin, my sweet wight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day is come, I may no longer bide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But evermore, where so I go or ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I is thine owen clerk, so have I hele.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, deare leman,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> quoth she, “go, fare wele:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ere thou go, one thing I will thee tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that thou wendest homeward by the mill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right at the entry of the door behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt a cake of half a bushel find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was y-maked of thine owen meal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that I help’d my father for to steal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And goode leman, God thee save and keep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word she gan almost to weep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein uprose and thought, “Ere the day daw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go creepen in by my fellaw:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found the cradle with his hand anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God!” thought he, “all wrong I have misgone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My head is totty of my swink<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> to-night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That maketh me that I go not aright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well by the cradle I have misgo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here lie the miller and his wife also.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went a twenty devil way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the bed, there as the miller lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> t’ have creeped by his fellow John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the miller in he crept anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caught him by the neck, and gan him shake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Thou John, thou swines-head, awake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Christes soul, and hear a noble game!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by that lord that called is Saint Jame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have thries in this shorte night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swived the miller’s daughter bolt-upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While thou hast as a coward lain aghast.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou false harlot,” quoth the miller, “hast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, false traitor, false clerk,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou shalt be dead, by Godde’s dignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who durste be so bold to disparage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My daughter, that is come of such lineage?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the throate-ball<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> he caught Alein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he him hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> dispiteously<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the nose he smote him with his fist;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the floor with nose and mouth all broke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They wallow, as do two pigs in a poke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up they go, and down again anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that the miller spurned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> on a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down he backward fell upon his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wiste nothing of this nice strife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was fall’n asleep a little wight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With John the clerk, that waked had all night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the fall out of her sleep she braid.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Help, holy cross of Bromeholm,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> she said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>In manus tuas!</i> Lord, to thee I call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awake, Simon, the fiend is on me fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine heart is broken; help; I am but dead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There li’th one on my womb and on mine head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help, Simkin, for these false clerks do fight”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This John start up as fast as e’er he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And groped by the walles to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find a staff; and she start up also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew the estres<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> better than this John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the wall she took a staff anon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw a little shimmering of a light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For at an hole in shone the moone bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by that light she saw them both the two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> she wist not who was who,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as she saw a white thing in her eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when she gan this white thing espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> the clerk had wear’d a volupere;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the staff she drew aye nere and nere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ween’d to have hit this Alein at the full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smote the miller on the pilled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> skull;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That down he went, and cried,” Harow! I die.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These clerkes beat him well, and let him lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greithen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> them, and take their horse anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke their meal, and on their way they gon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the mill door eke they took their cake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of half a bushel flour, full well y-bake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus is the proude miller well y-beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hath y-lost the grinding of the wheat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And payed for the supper every deal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Alein and of John, that beat him well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife is swived, and his daughter als;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, such it is a miller to be false.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore this proverb is said full sooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Him thar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> not winnen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> well that evil do’th,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A guiler shall himself beguiled be:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God that sitteth high in majesty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save all this Company, both great and smale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus have I quit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> the Miller in my tale.</span>
