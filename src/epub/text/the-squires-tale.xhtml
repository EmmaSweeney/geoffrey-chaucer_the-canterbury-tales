					<p>
						<span>At Sarra, in the land of Tartary,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There dwelt a king that warrayed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> Russie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which there died many a doughty man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king was called Cambuscan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which in his time was of so great renown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there was nowhere in no regioun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So excellent a lord in alle thing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him lacked nought that longeth to a king,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of the sect of which that he was born.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He kept his law to which he was y-sworn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thereto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> he was hardy, wise, and rich,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And piteous and just, always y-lich;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>True of his word, benign and honourable;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his corage as any centre stable;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As any bachelor of all his house.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fair person he was, and fortunate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept alway so well his royal estate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there was nowhere such another man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hadde two sons by Elfeta his wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the eldest highte Algarsife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other was y-called Camballo.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A daughter had this worthy king also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That youngest was, and highte Canace:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for to telle you all her beauty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It lies not in my tongue, nor my conning;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dare not undertake so high a thing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine English eke is insufficient,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It muste be a rhetor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> excellent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That couth his colours longing for that art,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he should her describen any part;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I am none such, I must speak as I can.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so befell, that when this Cambuscan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had twenty winters borne his diadem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he was wont from year to year, I deem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He let the feast of his nativity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do crye,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> throughout Sarra his city,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last Idus of March, after the year.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he was nigh his exaltation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Marte's face, and in his mansion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Aries, the choleric hot sign:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full lusty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> was the weather and benign;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which the fowls against the sunne sheen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>What for the season and the younge green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full loude sange their affections:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them seemed to have got protections</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the sword of winter keen and cold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Cambuscan, of which I have you told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In royal vesture, sat upon his dais,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With diadem, full high in his palace;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held his feast so solemn and so rich,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in this worlde was there none it lich.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which if I should tell all the array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then would it occupy a summer's day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke it needeth not for to devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>At every course the order of service.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not tellen of their strange sewes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor of their swannes, nor their heronsews.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eke in that land, as telle knightes old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is some meat that is full dainty hold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in this land men reck of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> it full small:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no man that may reporten all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not tarry you, for it is prime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for it is no fruit, but loss of time;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto my purpose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> I will have recourse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so befell that, after the third course,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While that this king sat thus in his nobley,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hearing his ministreles their thinges play</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him at his board deliciously,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In at the halle door all suddenly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came a knight upon a steed of brass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in his hand a broad mirror of glass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by his side a naked sword hanging:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up he rode unto the highe board.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the hall was there not spoke a word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For marvel of this knight; him to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full busily they waited,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> young and old.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This strange knight, that came thus suddenly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All armed, save his head, full richely,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saluted king, and queen, and lordes all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By order as they satten in the hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so high reverence and observance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well in speech as in his countenance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Gawain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> with his olde courtesy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though he were come again out of Faerie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him coulde not amende with a word.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after this, before the highe board,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with a manly voice said his message,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After the form used in his language,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoute vice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> of syllable or letter.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, for his tale shoulde seem the better,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accordant to his worde's was his cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As teacheth art of speech them that it lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Albeit that I cannot sound his style,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor cannot climb over so high a stile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet say I this, as to commune intent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus much amounteth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> all that ever he meant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If it so be that I have it in mind.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He said; "The king of Araby and Ind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My liege lord, on this solemne day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saluteth you as he best can and may,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sendeth you, in honour of your feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By me, that am all ready at your hest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>This steed of brass, that easily and well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can in the space of one day naturel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(This is to say, in four-and-twenty hours),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereso you list, in drought or else in show'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beare your body into every place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which your hearte willeth for to pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoute wem<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> of you, through foul or fair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or if you list to fly as high in air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As doth an eagle, when him list to soar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This same steed shall bear you evermore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoute harm, till ye be where you lest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Though that ye sleepen on his back, or rest),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn again, with writhing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> of a pin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He that it wrought, he coude<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> many a gin;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He waited<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> in any a constellation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere he had done this operation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew full many a seal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> and many a bond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This mirror eke, that I have in mine hond,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath such a might, that men may in it see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When there shall fall any adversity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto your realm, or to yourself also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And openly who is your friend or foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over all this, if any lady bright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath set her heart on any manner wight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he be false, she shall his treason see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His newe love, and all his subtlety,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So openly that there shall nothing hide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore, against this lusty summer-tide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This mirror, and this ring that ye may see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He hath sent to my lady Canace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your excellente daughter that is here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The virtue of this ring, if ye will hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is this, that if her list it for to wear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her thumb, or in her purse it bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no fowl that flyeth under heaven,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she shall not well understand his steven,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And know his meaning openly and plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And answer him in his language again:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And every grass that groweth upon root</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She shall eke know, to whom it will do boot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>All be his woundes ne'er so deep and wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This naked sword, that hangeth by my side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such virtue hath, that what man that it smite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Throughout his armour it will carve and bite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were it as thick as is a branched oak:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what man is y-wounded with the stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall ne'er be whole, till that you list, of grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stroke him with the flat in thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where he is hurt; this is as much to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye muste with the flatte sword again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stroke him upon the wound, and it will close.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is the very sooth, withoute glose;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>It faileth not, while it is in your hold."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And when this knight had thus his tale told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rode out of the hall, and down he light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His steede, which that shone as sunne bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood in the court as still as any stone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The knight is to his chamber led anon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And is unarmed, and to meat y-set.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>These presents be full richely y-fet,—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is to say, the sword and the mirrour,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And borne anon into the highe tow'r,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With certain officers ordain'd therefor;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And unto Canace the ring is bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Solemnely, where she sat at the table;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sickerly, withouten any fable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse of brass, that may not be remued.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>It stood as it were to the ground y-glued;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There may no man out of the place it drive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no engine of windlass or polive;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cause why, for they can not the craft;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore in the place they have it laft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the knight hath taught them the mannere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To voide<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> him, as ye shall after hear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Great was the press, that swarmed to and fro</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To gauren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> on this horse that stoode so:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it so high was, and so broad and long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So well proportioned for to be strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as it were a steed of Lombardy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therewith so horsely, and so quick of eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As it a gentle Poileis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> courser were:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For certes, from his tail unto his ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nature nor art ne could him not amend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In no degree, as all the people wend.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But evermore their moste wonder was</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that it coulde go, and was of brass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was of Faerie, as the people seem'd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Diverse folk diversely they deem'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As many heads, as many wittes been.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They murmured, as doth a swarm of been,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made skills<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> after their fantasies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rehearsing of the olde poetries,</span>
						<br/>

						<span>At after supper went this noble king</span>

						<span>To see the horse of brass, with all a rout</span>

						<span>When that she swooned next, for lack of blood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A longe while to waite her she stood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till at the last she apake in this mannere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the hawk, as ye shall after hear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"What is the cause, if it be for to tell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ye be in this furial<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> pain of hell?"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quoth Canace unto this hawk above;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Is this for sorrow of of death; or loss of love?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For; as I trow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> these be the causes two;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cause most a gentle hearte woe:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of other harm it needeth not to speak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ye yourself upon yourself awreak;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which proveth well, that either ire or dread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must be occasion of your cruel deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since that I see none other wight you chase:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For love of God, as do yourselfe grace;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or what may be your help? for, west nor east,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I never saw ere now no bird nor beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fared with himself so piteously</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye slay me with your sorrow verily;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have of you so great compassioun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Godde's love come from the tree adown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as I am a kinge's daughter true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that I verily the causes knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of your disease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> if it lay in my might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I would amend it, ere that it were night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> help me the great God of kind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And herbes shall I right enoughe find,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To heale with your hurtes hastily."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then shriek'd this falcon yet more piteously</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ever she did, and fell to ground anon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lay aswoon, as dead as lies a stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till Canace had in her lap her take,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto that time she gan of swoon awake:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, after that she out of swoon abraid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right in her hawke's leden thus she said:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"That pity runneth soon in gentle heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Feeling his simil'tude in paines smart),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is proved every day, as men may see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well by work as by authority;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>For gentle hearte kitheth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> gentleness.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see well, that ye have on my distress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compassion, my faire Canace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of very womanly benignity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That nature in your princples hath set.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for no hope for to fare the bet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for t' obey unto your hearte free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for to make others aware by me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by the whelp chastis'd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> is the lion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right for that cause and that conclusion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While that I have a leisure and a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine harm I will confessen ere I pace."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever while the one her sorrow told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other wept, as she to water wo'ld,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the falcon bade her to be still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a sigh right thus she said her till:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Where I was bred (alas that ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> day!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And foster'd in a rock of marble gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So tenderly, that nothing ailed me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I wiste not what was adversity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till I could flee full high under the sky.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then dwell'd a tercelet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> me faste by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seem'd a well of alle gentleness;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All were he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> full of treason and falseness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was so wrapped under humble cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And under hue of truth, in such mannere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under pleasance, and under busy pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That no wight weened that he coulde feign,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So deep in grain he dyed his colours.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as a serpent hides him under flow'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he may see his time for to bite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right so this god of love's hypocrite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did so his ceremonies and obeisances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept in semblance all his observances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sounden unto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> gentleness of love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As on a tomb is all the fair above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And under is the corpse, which that ye wet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such was this hypocrite, both cold and hot;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in this wise he served his intent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, save the fiend, none wiste what he meant:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he so long had weeped and complain'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a year his service to me feign'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that mine heart, too piteous and too nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>All innocent of his crowned malice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forfeared of his death,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> as thoughte me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his oathes and his surety</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Granted him love, on this conditioun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That evermore mine honour and renown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were saved, bothe privy and apert;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is to say, that, after his desert,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I gave him all my heart and all my thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(God wot, and he, that other wayes nought),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took his heart in change of mine for aye.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sooth is said, gone since many a day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A true wight and a thiefe think not one.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he saw the thing so far y-gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I had granted him fully my love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In such a wise as I have said above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And given him my true heart as free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he swore that he gave his heart to me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon this tiger, full of doubleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell on his knees with so great humbleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so high reverence, as by his cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>So like a gentle lover in mannere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ravish'd, as it seemed, for the joy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never Jason, nor Paris of Troy,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jason? certes, nor ever other man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Lamech was, that alderfirst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To love two, as write folk beforn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor ever since the firste man was born,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Coulde no man, by twenty thousand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Counterfeit the sophimes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> of his art;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where doubleness of feigning should approach,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor worthy were t'unbuckle his galoche,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor could so thank a wight, as he did me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His manner was a heaven for to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To any woman, were she ne'er so wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So painted he and kempt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> at point devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well his wordes as his countenance.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I so lov'd him for his obeisance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the truth I deemed in his heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, if so were that any thing him smart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>All were it ne'er so lite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> and I it wist,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Methought I felt death at my hearte twist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shortly, so farforth this thing is went,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That my will was his wille's instrument;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is to say, my will obey'd his will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In alle thing, as far as reason fill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Keeping the boundes of my worship ever;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never had I thing so lefe, or lever,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As him, God wot, nor never shall no mo'.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"This lasted longer than a year or two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I supposed of him naught but good.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But finally, thus at the last it stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fortune woulde that he muste twin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of that place which that I was in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whe'er<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> me was woe, it is no question;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot make of it description.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For one thing dare I telle boldely,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I know what is the pain of death thereby;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such harm I felt, for he might not byleve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>So on a day of me he took his leave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So sorrowful eke, that I ween'd verily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he had felt as muche harm as I,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that I heard him speak, and saw his hue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless, I thought he was so true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke that he repaire should again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within a little while, sooth to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reason would eke that he muste go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For his honour, as often happ'neth so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I made virtue of necessity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took it well, since that it muste be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I best might, I hid from him my sorrow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took him by the hand, Saint John to borrow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said him thus; 'Lo, I am youres all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be such as I have been to you, and shall.'</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What he answer'd, it needs not to rehearse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who can say bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> than he, who can do worse?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he had all well said, then had he done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore behoveth him a full long spoon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shall eat with a fiend; thus heard I say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So at the last he muste forth his way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth he flew, till he came where him lest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When it came him to purpose for to rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I trow that he had thilke text in mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That alle thing repairing to his kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gladdeth himself;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> thus say men, as I guess;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men love of [proper] kind newfangleness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As birdes do, that men in cages feed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though thou night and day take of them heed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strew their cage fair and soft as silk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And give them sugar, honey, bread, and milk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, right anon as that his door is up,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with his feet will spurne down his cup,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the wood he will, and wormes eat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So newefangle be they of their meat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And love novelties, of proper kind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No gentleness of bloode may them bind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So far'd this tercelet, alas the day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though he were gentle born, and fresh, and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And goodly for to see, and humble, and free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw upon a time a kite flee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly he loved this kite so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all his love is clean from me y-go:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hath his trothe falsed in this wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus hath the kite my love in her service,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I am lorn<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> withoute remedy."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And with that word this falcon gan to cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swooned eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> in Canacee's barme.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great was the sorrow, for that hawke's harm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Canace and all her women made;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wist not how they might the falcon glade.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Canace home bare her in her lap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And softely in plasters gan her wrap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There as she with her beak had hurt herselve.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now cannot Canace but herbes delve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the ground, and make salves new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of herbes precious and fine of hue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To heale with this hawk; from day to night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She did her business, and all her might.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by her bedde's head she made a mew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cover'd it with velouettes blue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In sign of truth that is in woman seen;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all without the mew is painted green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which were painted all these false fowls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As be these tidifes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> tercelets, and owls;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pies, on them for to cry and chide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right for despite were painted them beside.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus leave I Canace her hawk keeping.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will no more as now speak of her ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till it come eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> to purpose for to sayn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that this falcon got her love again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Repentant, as the story telleth us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By mediation of Camballus,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kinge's son of which that I you told.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But henceforth I will my process hold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To speak of aventures, and of battailes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That yet was never heard so great marvailles.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First I will telle you of Cambuscan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in his time many a city wan;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after will I speak of Algarsife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How he won Theodora to his wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whom full oft in great peril he was,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>N'had he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> been holpen by the horse of brass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after will I speak of Camballo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fought in listes with the brethren two</span>
