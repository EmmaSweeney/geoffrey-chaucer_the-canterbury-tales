				<p>Notes to the Prologue to the Squire's Tale</p>
				<p>1. Women connen utter such chaffare: women are adepts at giving circulation to such wares. The Host evidently means that his wife would be sure to hear of his confessions from some female member of the company.</p>

					<h4 epub:type="title">*Pars Prima* *First part*</h4>
					<p>
						<span>At Sarra, in the land of Tartary,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There dwelt a king that warrayed* Russie, &lt;2&gt; *made war on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which there died many a doughty man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king was called Cambuscan,&lt;3&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which in his time was of so great renown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there was nowhere in no regioun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So excellent a lord in alle thing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him lacked nought that longeth to a king,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of the sect of which that he was born.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He kept his law to which he was y-sworn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thereto* he was hardy, wise, and rich, *moreover, besides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And piteous and just, always y-lich;* *alike, even-tempered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>True of his word, benign and honourable;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*Of his corage as any centre stable;* *firm, immovable of spirit*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As any bachelor of all his house.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fair person he was, and fortunate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept alway so well his royal estate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there was nowhere such another man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hadde two sons by Elfeta his wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the eldest highte Algarsife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other was y-called Camballo.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A daughter had this worthy king also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That youngest was, and highte Canace:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for to telle you all her beauty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It lies not in my tongue, nor my conning;* *skill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dare not undertake so high a thing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine English eke is insufficient,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It muste be a rhetor* excellent, *orator</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*That couth his colours longing for that art,* * see &lt;4&gt;*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he should her describen any part;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I am none such, I must speak as I can.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so befell, that when this Cambuscan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had twenty winters borne his diadem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he was wont from year to year, I deem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He let *the feast of his nativity* *his birthday party*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*Do crye,* throughout Sarra his city, *be proclaimed*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last Idus of March, after the year.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he was nigh his exaltation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Marte's face, and in his mansion &lt;5&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Aries, the choleric hot sign:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full lusty* was the weather and benign; *pleasant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which the fowls against the sunne sheen,* *bright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What for the season and the younge green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full loude sange their affections:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them seemed to have got protections</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the sword of winter keen and cold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Cambuscan, of which I have you told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In royal vesture, sat upon his dais,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With diadem, full high in his palace;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held his feast so solemn and so rich,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in this worlde was there none it lich.* *like</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which if I should tell all the array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then would it occupy a summer's day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke it needeth not for to devise* *describe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At every course the order of service.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not tellen of their strange sewes,* *dishes &lt;6&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor of their swannes, nor their heronsews.* *young herons &lt;7&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eke in that land, as telle knightes old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is some meat that is full dainty hold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in this land men *reck of* it full small: *care for*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no man that may reporten all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not tarry you, for it is prime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for it is no fruit, but loss of time;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto my purpose* I will have recourse. *story &lt;8&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so befell that, after the third course,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While that this king sat thus in his nobley,* *noble array</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hearing his ministreles their thinges play</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him at his board deliciously,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In at the halle door all suddenly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came a knight upon a steed of brass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in his hand a broad mirror of glass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by his side a naked sword hanging:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up he rode unto the highe board.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the hall was there not spoke a word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For marvel of this knight; him to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full busily they waited,* young and old. *watched</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This strange knight, that came thus suddenly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All armed, save his head, full richely,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saluted king, and queen, and lordes all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By order as they satten in the hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so high reverence and observance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well in speech as in his countenance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Gawain &lt;9&gt; with his olde courtesy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though he were come again out of Faerie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him *coulde not amende with a word.* *could not better him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after this, before the highe board, by one word*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with a manly voice said his message,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After the form used in his language,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoute vice* of syllable or letter. *fault</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, for his tale shoulde seem the better,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accordant to his worde's was his cheer,* *demeanour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As teacheth art of speech them that it lear.* *learn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Albeit that I cannot sound his style,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor cannot climb over so high a stile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet say I this, as to *commune intent,* *general sense or meaning*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*Thus much amounteth* all that ever he meant, *this is the sum of*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If it so be that I have it in mind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He said; "The king of Araby and Ind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My liege lord, on this solemne day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saluteth you as he best can and may,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sendeth you, in honour of your feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By me, that am all ready at your hest,* *command</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This steed of brass, that easily and well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can in the space of one day naturel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(This is to say, in four-and-twenty hours),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereso you list, in drought or else in show'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beare your body into every place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which your hearte willeth for to pace,* *pass, go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoute wem* of you, through foul or fair. *hurt, injury</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or if you list to fly as high in air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As doth an eagle, when him list to soar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This same steed shall bear you evermore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoute harm, till ye be where *you lest* *it pleases you*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Though that ye sleepen on his back, or rest),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn again, with writhing* of a pin. *twisting</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He that it wrought, he coude* many a gin;** *knew **contrivance &lt;10&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He waited* in any a constellation, *observed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere he had done this operation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew full many a seal &lt;11&gt; and many a bond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This mirror eke, that I have in mine hond,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath such a might, that men may in it see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When there shall fall any adversity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto your realm, or to yourself also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And openly who is your friend or foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over all this, if any lady bright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath set her heart on any manner wight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he be false, she shall his treason see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His newe love, and all his subtlety,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So openly that there shall nothing hide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore, against this lusty summer-tide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This mirror, and this ring that ye may see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He hath sent to my lady Canace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your excellente daughter that is here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The virtue of this ring, if ye will hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is this, that if her list it for to wear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her thumb, or in her purse it bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no fowl that flyeth under heaven,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she shall not well understand his steven,* *speech, sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And know his meaning openly and plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And answer him in his language again:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And every grass that groweth upon root</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She shall eke know, to whom it will do boot,* *remedy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All be his woundes ne'er so deep and wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This naked sword, that hangeth by my side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such virtue hath, that what man that it smite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Throughout his armour it will carve and bite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were it as thick as is a branched oak:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what man is y-wounded with the stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall ne'er be whole, till that you list, of grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stroke him with the flat in thilke* place *the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where he is hurt; this is as much to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye muste with the flatte sword again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stroke him upon the wound, and it will close.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is the very sooth, withoute glose;* *deceit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It faileth not, while it is in your hold."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And when this knight had thus his tale told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rode out of the hall, and down he light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His steede, which that shone as sunne bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood in the court as still as any stone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The knight is to his chamber led anon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And is unarmed, and to meat y-set.* *seated</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These presents be full richely y-fet,* — *fetched</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is to say, the sword and the mirrour, —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And borne anon into the highe tow'r,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With certain officers ordain'd therefor;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And unto Canace the ring is bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Solemnely, where she sat at the table;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sickerly, withouten any fable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse of brass, that may not be remued.* *removed &lt;12&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It stood as it were to the ground y-glued;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There may no man out of the place it drive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no engine of windlass or polive; * *pulley</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cause why, for they *can not the craft;* *know not the cunning</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore in the place they have it laft, of the mechanism*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the knight hath taught them the mannere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To voide* him, as ye shall after hear. *remove</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Great was the press, that swarmed to and fro</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To gauren* on this horse that stoode so: *gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it so high was, and so broad and long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So well proportioned for to be strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as it were a steed of Lombardy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therewith so horsely, and so quick of eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As it a gentle Poileis &lt;13&gt; courser were:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For certes, from his tail unto his ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nature nor art ne could him not amend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In no degree, as all the people wend.* *weened, thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But evermore their moste wonder was</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that it coulde go, and was of brass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was of Faerie, as the people seem'd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Diverse folk diversely they deem'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As many heads, as many wittes been.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They murmured, as doth a swarm of been,* *bees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made skills* after their fantasies, *reasons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rehearsing of the olde poetries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said that it was like the Pegasee,* *Pegasus</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse that hadde winges for to flee;* *fly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or else it was the Greeke's horse Sinon,&lt;14&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That broughte Troye to destruction,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As men may in the olde gestes* read. *tales of adventures</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine heart," quoth one, "is evermore in dread;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I trow some men of armes be therein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shape* them this city for to win: *design, prepare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It were right good that all such thing were know."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another rowned* to his fellow low, *whispered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said, "He lies; for it is rather like</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An apparence made by some magic,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As jugglers playen at these feastes great."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sundry doubts they jangle thus and treat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As lewed* people deeme commonly *ignorant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thinges that be made more subtilly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than they can in their lewdness comprehend;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They *deeme gladly to the badder end.* *are ready to think</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some of them wonder'd on the mirrour, the worst*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That borne was up into the master* tow'r, *chief &lt;15&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How men might in it suche thinges see.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another answer'd and said, it might well be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Naturally by compositions</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of angles, and of sly reflections;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saide that in Rome was such a one.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They speak of Alhazen and Vitellon,&lt;16&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Aristotle, that wrote in their lives</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of quainte* mirrors, and of prospectives, *curious</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As knowe they that have their bookes heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And other folk have wonder'd on the swerd,* *sword</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That woulde pierce throughout every thing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fell in speech of Telephus the king,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of Achilles for his quainte spear, &lt;17&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he could with it bothe heal and dere,* *wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right in such wise as men may with the swerd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which right now ye have yourselves heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They spake of sundry hard'ning of metal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spake of medicines therewithal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how, and when, it shoulde harden'd be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which is unknowen algate* unto me. *however</span>

						<span>Then spake they of Canacee's ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saiden all, that such a wondrous thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of craft of rings heard they never none,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save that he, Moses, and King Solomon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hadden *a name of conning* in such art. *a reputation for</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Put natheless some saide that it was</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wonder to maken of fern ashes glass,</span>

						<span>And yet is glass nought like ashes of fern;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*But for* they have y-knowen it so ferne** *because **before &lt;18&gt;</span>

						<span>Therefore ceaseth their jangling and their wonder.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As sore wonder some on cause of thunder,</span>

						<span>And looked on them with a friendly eye. &lt;21&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king is set upon his throne;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This strange knight is fetched to him full sone,* *soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on the dance he goes with Canace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here is the revel and the jollity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is not able a dull man to devise:* *describe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He must have knowen love and his service,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And been a feastly* man, as fresh as May, *merry, gay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shoulde you devise such array.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who coulde telle you the form of dances</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So uncouth,* and so freshe countenances** *unfamliar **gestures</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such subtle lookings and dissimulances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For dread of jealous men's apperceivings?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No man but Launcelot,&lt;22&gt; and he is dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore I pass o'er all this lustihead* *pleasantness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I say no more, but in this jolliness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I leave them, till to supper men them dress.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steward bids the spices for to hie* *haste</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke the wine, in all this melody;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ushers and the squiers be y-gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spices and the wine is come anon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They eat and drink, and when this hath an end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the temple, as reason was, they wend;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The service done, they suppen all by day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What needeth you rehearse their array?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each man wot well, that at a kinge's feast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is plenty, to the most*, and to the least, *highest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dainties more than be in my knowing.</span>

					<p>
						<span>At after supper went this noble king</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see the horse of brass, with all a rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of lordes and of ladies him about.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such wond'ring was there on this horse of brass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, since the great siege of Troye was,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There as men wonder'd on a horse also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ne'er was there such a wond'ring as was tho.* *there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But finally the king asked the knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The virtue of this courser, and the might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prayed him to tell his governance.* *mode of managing him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse anon began to trip and dance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that the knight laid hand upon his rein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saide, "Sir, there is no more to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when you list to riden anywhere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye muste trill* a pin, stands in his ear, *turn &lt;23&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which I shall telle you betwixt us two;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye muste name him to what place also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or to what country that you list to ride.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when ye come where you list abide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bid him descend, and trill another pin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For therein lies th' effect of all the gin*), *contrivance &lt;10&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he will down descend and do your will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in that place he will abide still;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though all the world had the contrary swore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shall not thence be throwen nor be bore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or, if you list to bid him thennes gon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trill this pin, and he will vanish anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the sight of every manner wight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And come again, be it by day or night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that you list to clepe* him again *call</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In such a guise, as I shall to you sayn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betwixte you and me, and that full soon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ride &lt;24&gt; when you list, there is no more to do'n.'</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Informed when the king was of the knight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had conceived in his wit aright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The manner and the form of all this thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full glad and blithe, this noble doughty king</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Repaired to his revel as beforn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bridle is into the tower borne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept among his jewels lefe* and dear; *cherished</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse vanish'd, I n'ot* in what mannere, *know not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of their sight; ye get no more of me:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But thus I leave in lust and jollity</span>

						<span>This Cambuscan his lordes feastying,* *entertaining &lt;25&gt;</span>

						<span>Amid a tree fordry*, as white as chalk, *thoroughly dried up</span>

						<span>There sat a falcon o'er her head full high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with a piteous voice so gan to cry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all the wood resounded of her cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beat she had herself so piteously</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With both her winges, till the redde blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran endelong* the tree, there as she stood *from top to bottom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever-in-one* alway she cried and shright;** *incessantly **shrieked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with her beak herselfe she so pight,* *wounded</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there is no tiger, nor cruel beast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dwelleth either in wood or in forest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But would have wept, if that he weepe could,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For sorrow of her; she shriek'd alway so loud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there was never yet no man alive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that he could a falcon well descrive;* *describe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That heard of such another of fairness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well of plumage, as of gentleness;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of shape, of all that mighte reckon'd be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A falcon peregrine seemed she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fremde* land; and ever as she stood *foreign &lt;28&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She swooned now and now for lack of blood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till well-nigh is she fallen from the tree.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This faire kinge's daughter Canace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That on her finger bare the quainte ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which she understood well every thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That any fowl may in his leden* sayn, **language &lt;29&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And could him answer in his leden again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath understoode what this falcon said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And well-nigh for the ruth* almost she died;. *pity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the tree she went, full hastily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on this falcon looked piteously;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held her lap abroad; for well she wist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The falcon muste falle from the twist* *twig, bough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that she swooned next, for lack of blood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A longe while to waite her she stood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till at the last she apake in this mannere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the hawk, as ye shall after hear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"What is the cause, if it be for to tell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ye be in this furial* pain of hell?" *raging, furious</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quoth Canace unto this hawk above;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Is this for sorrow of of death; or loss of love?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For; as I trow,* these be the causes two; *believe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cause most a gentle hearte woe:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of other harm it needeth not to speak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ye yourself upon yourself awreak;* *inflict</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which proveth well, that either ire or dread* *fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must be occasion of your cruel deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since that I see none other wight you chase:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For love of God, as *do yourselfe grace;* *have mercy on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or what may be your help? for, west nor east, yourself*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I never saw ere now no bird nor beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fared with himself so piteously</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye slay me with your sorrow verily;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have of you so great compassioun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Godde's love come from the tree adown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as I am a kinge's daughter true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that I verily the causes knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of your disease,* if it lay in my might, *distress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I would amend it, ere that it were night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So wisly help me the great God of kind.** *surely **nature</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And herbes shall I right enoughe find,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To heale with your hurtes hastily."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then shriek'd this falcon yet more piteously</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ever she did, and fell to ground anon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lay aswoon, as dead as lies a stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till Canace had in her lap her take,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto that time she gan of swoon awake:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, after that she out of swoon abraid,* *awoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right in her hawke's leden thus she said:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"That pity runneth soon in gentle heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Feeling his simil'tude in paines smart),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is proved every day, as men may see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well *by work as by authority;* *by experience as by doctrine*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For gentle hearte kitheth* gentleness. *sheweth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see well, that ye have on my distress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compassion, my faire Canace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of very womanly benignity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That nature in your princples hath set.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for no hope for to fare the bet,* *better</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for t' obey unto your hearte free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for to make others aware by me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by the whelp chastis'd* is the lion, *instructed, corrected</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right for that cause and that conclusion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While that I have a leisure and a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine harm I will confessen ere I pace."* *depart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever while the one her sorrow told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other wept, *as she to water wo'ld,* *as if she would dissolve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the falcon bade her to be still, into water*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a sigh right thus she said *her till:* *to her*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Where I was bred (alas that ilke* day!) *same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And foster'd in a rock of marble gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So tenderly, that nothing ailed me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I wiste* not what was adversity, *knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till I could flee* full high under the sky. *fly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then dwell'd a tercelet &lt;30&gt; me faste by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seem'd a well of alle gentleness;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*All were he* full of treason and falseness, *although he was*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was so wrapped *under humble cheer,* *under an aspect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And under hue of truth, in such mannere, of humility*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under pleasance, and under busy pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That no wight weened that he coulde feign,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So deep in grain he dyed his colours.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as a serpent hides him under flow'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he may see his time for to bite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right so this god of love's hypocrite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did so his ceremonies and obeisances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept in semblance all his observances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That *sounden unto* gentleness of love. *are consonant to*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As on a tomb is all the fair above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And under is the corpse, which that ye wet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such was this hypocrite, both cold and hot;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in this wise he served his intent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, save the fiend, none wiste what he meant:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he so long had weeped and complain'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a year his service to me feign'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that mine heart, too piteous and too nice,* *foolish, simple</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All innocent of his crowned malice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*Forfeared of his death,* as thoughte me, *greatly afraid lest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his oathes and his surety he should die*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Granted him love, on this conditioun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That evermore mine honour and renown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were saved, bothe *privy and apert;* *privately and in public*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is to say, that, after his desert,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I gave him all my heart and all my thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(God wot, and he, that *other wayes nought*), *in no other way*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took his heart in change of mine for aye.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sooth is said, gone since many a day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A true wight and a thiefe *think not one.* *do not think alike*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he saw the thing so far y-gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I had granted him fully my love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In such a wise as I have said above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And given him my true heart as free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he swore that he gave his heart to me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon this tiger, full of doubleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell on his knees with so great humbleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so high reverence, as by his cheer,* *mien</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So like a gentle lover in mannere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ravish'd, as it seemed, for the joy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never Jason, nor Paris of Troy, —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jason? certes, nor ever other man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Lamech &lt;31&gt; was, that alderfirst* began *first of all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To love two, as write folk beforn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor ever since the firste man was born,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Coulde no man, by twenty thousand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Counterfeit the sophimes* of his art; *sophistries, beguilements</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where doubleness of feigning should approach,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor worthy were t'unbuckle his galoche,* *shoe &lt;32&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor could so thank a wight, as he did me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His manner was a heaven for to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To any woman, were she ne'er so wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So painted he and kempt,* *at point devise,* *combed, studied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well his wordes as his countenance. *with perfect precision*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I so lov'd him for his obeisance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the truth I deemed in his heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, if so were that any thing him smart,* *pained</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All were it ne'er so lite,* and I it wist, *little</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Methought I felt death at my hearte twist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shortly, so farforth this thing is went,* *gone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That my will was his wille's instrument;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is to say, my will obey'd his will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In alle thing, as far as reason fill,* *fell; allowed</span>

						<span>That fortune woulde that he muste twin* *depart, separate</span>

						<span>Such harm I felt, for he might not byleve.* *stay &lt;33&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So on a day of me he took his leave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So sorrowful eke, that I ween'd verily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he had felt as muche harm as I,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that I heard him speak, and saw his hue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless, I thought he was so true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke that he repaire should again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within a little while, sooth to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reason would eke that he muste go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For his honour, as often happ'neth so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I made virtue of necessity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took it well, since that it muste be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I best might, I hid from him my sorrow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took him by the hand, Saint John to borrow,* *witness, pledge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said him thus; 'Lo, I am youres all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be such as I have been to you, and shall.'</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What he answer'd, it needs not to rehearse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who can say bet* than he, who can do worse? *better</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he had all well said, then had he done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore behoveth him a full long spoon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shall eat with a fiend; thus heard I say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So at the last he muste forth his way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth he flew, till he came where him lest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When it came him to purpose for to rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I trow that he had thilke text in mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That alle thing repairing to his kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gladdeth himself; &lt;34&gt; thus say men, as I guess;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*Men love of [proper] kind newfangleness,* *see note &lt;35&gt;*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As birdes do, that men in cages feed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though thou night and day take of them heed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strew their cage fair and soft as silk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And give them sugar, honey, bread, and milk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, *right anon as that his door is up,* *immediately on his</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with his feet will spurne down his cup, door being opened*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the wood he will, and wormes eat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So newefangle be they of their meat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And love novelties, of proper kind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No gentleness of bloode may them bind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So far'd this tercelet, alas the day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though he were gentle born, and fresh, and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And goodly for to see, and humble, and free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw upon a time a kite flee,* *fly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly he loved this kite so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all his love is clean from me y-go:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hath his trothe falsed in this wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus hath the kite my love in her service,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I am lorn* withoute remedy." *lost, undone</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And with that word this falcon gan to cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swooned eft* in Canacee's barme** *again **lap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great was the sorrow, for that hawke's harm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Canace and all her women made;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wist not how they might the falcon glade.* *gladden</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Canace home bare her in her lap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And softely in plasters gan her wrap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There as she with her beak had hurt herselve.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now cannot Canace but herbes delve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the ground, and make salves new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of herbes precious and fine of hue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To heale with this hawk; from day to night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She did her business, and all her might.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by her bedde's head she made a mew,* *bird cage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cover'd it with velouettes* blue,&lt;36&gt; *velvets</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In sign of truth that is in woman seen;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all without the mew is painted green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which were painted all these false fowls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As be these tidifes,* tercelets, and owls; *titmice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pies, on them for to cry and chide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right for despite were painted them beside.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus leave I Canace her hawk keeping.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will no more as now speak of her ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till it come eft* to purpose for to sayn *again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that this falcon got her love again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Repentant, as the story telleth us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By mediation of Camballus,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kinge's son of which that I you told.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But henceforth I will my process hold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To speak of aventures, and of battailes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That yet was never heard so great marvailles.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First I will telle you of Cambuscan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in his time many a city wan;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after will I speak of Algarsife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How he won Theodora to his wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whom full oft in great peril he was,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>*N'had he* been holpen by the horse of brass. *had he not*</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after will I speak of Camballo, &lt;37&gt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fought in listes with the brethren two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Canace, ere that he might her win;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where I left I will again begin.</span>

					<p>Notes to the Squire's Tale</p>
					<p>1. The Squire's Tale has not been found under any other form among the literary remains of the Middle Ages; and it is unknown from what original it was derived, if from any. The Tale is unfinished, not because the conclusion has been lost, but because the author left it so.</p>
					<p>2. The Russians and Tartars waged constant hostilities between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>
					<p>3. In the best manuscripts the name is "Cambynskan," and thus, no doubt, it should strictly be read. But it is a most pardonable offence against literal accuracy to use the word which Milton has made classical, in "Il Penseroso," speaking of</p>
					<p>"him that left half-told The story of Cambuscan bold, Of Camball, and of Algarsife, And who had Canace to wife, That owned the virtuous Ring and Glass, And of the wondrous Horse of Brass, On which the Tartar King did ride"</p>
					<p>Surely the admiration of Milton might well seem to the spirit of Chaucer to condone a much greater transgression on his domain than this verbal change — which to both eye and ear is an unquestionable improvement on the uncouth original.</p>
					<p>4. Couth his colours longing for that art: well skilled in using the colours — the word-painting — belonging to his art.</p>
					<p>5. Aries was the mansion of Mars — to whom "his" applies. Leo was the mansion of the Sun.</p>
					<p>6. Sewes: Dishes, or soups. The precise force of the word is uncertain; but it may be connected with "seethe," to boil, and it seems to describe a dish in which the flesh was served up amid a kind of broth or gravy. The "sewer," taster or assayer of the viands served at great tables, probably derived his name from the verb to "say" or "assay;" though Tyrwhitt would connect the two words, by taking both from the French, "asseoir," to place — making the arrangement of the table the leading duty of the "sewer," rather than the testing of the food.</p>
					<p>7. Heronsews: young herons; French, "heronneaux."</p>
					<p>8. Purpose: story, discourse; French, "propos."</p>
					<p>9. Gawain was celebrated in mediaeval romance as the most courteous among King Arthur's knights.</p>
					<p>10. Gin: contrivance; trick; snare. Compare Italian, "inganno," deception; and our own "engine."</p>
					<p>11. Mr Wright remarks that "the making and arrangement of seals was one of the important operations of mediaeval magic."</p>
					<p>12. Remued: removed; French, "remuer," to stir.</p>
					<p>13. Polies: Apulian. The horses of Apulia — in old French "Poille," in Italian "Puglia" — were held in high value.</p>
					<p>14. The Greeke's horse Sinon: the wooden horse of the Greek Sinon, introduced into Troy by the stratagem of its maker.</p>
					<p>15. Master tower: chief tower; as, in the Knight's Tale, the principal street is called the "master street." See note 86 to the Knight's Tale.</p>
					<p>16. Alhazen and Vitellon: two writers on optics — the first supposed to have lived about 1100, the other about 1270. Tyrwhitt says that their works were printed at Basle in 1572, under the title "Alhazeni et Vitellonis Opticae."</p>
					<p>17. Telephus, a son of Hercules, reigned over Mysia when the Greeks came to besiege Troy, and he sought to prevent their landing. But, by the art of Dionysus, he was made to stumble over a vine, and Achilles wounded him with his spear. The oracle informed Telephus that the hurt could be healed only by him, or by the weapon, that inflicted it; and the king, seeking the Grecian camp, was healed by Achilles with the rust of the charmed spear.</p>
					<p>18. Ferne: before; a corruption of "forne," from Anglo-Saxon, "foran."</p>
					<p>19. Aldrian: or Aldebaran; a star in the neck of the constellation Leo.</p>
					<p>20. Chamber of parements: Presence-chamber, or chamber of state, full of splendid furniture and ornaments. The same expression is used in French and Italian.</p>
					<p>21. In Pisces, Venus was said to be at her exaltation or greatest power. A planet, according to the old astrologers, was in "exaltation" when in the sign of the Zodiac in which it exerted its strongest influence; the opposite sign, in which it was weakest, was called its "dejection."</p>
					<p>22. Launcelot: Arthur's famous knight, so accomplished and courtly, that he was held the very pink of chivalry.</p>
					<p>23. Trill: turn; akin to "thirl", "drill."</p>
					<p>24. Ride: another reading is "bide," alight or remain.</p>
					<p>25. Feastying: entertaining; French, "festoyer," to feast.</p>
					<p>26. The old physicians held that blood dominated in the human body late at night and in the early morning. Galen says that the domination lasts for seven hours.</p>
					<p>27. Fumosity: fumes of wine rising from the stomach to the head.</p>
					<p>28. Fremde: foreign, strange; German, "fremd" in the northern dialects, "frem," or "fremmed," is used in the same sense.</p>
					<p>29. Leden: Language, dialect; from Anglo-Saxon, "leden" or "laeden," a corruption from "Latin."</p>
					<p>30. Tercelet: the "tassel," or male of any species of hawk; so called, according to Cotgrave, because he is one third ("tiers") smaller than the female.</p>
					<p>31. "And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one Adah, and the name of the other Zillah" (Gen. iv. 19).</p>
					<p>32. Galoche: shoe; it seems to have been used in France, of a "sabot," or wooden shoe. The reader cannot fail to recall the same illustration in John i. 27, where the Baptist says of Christ: "He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me; whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."</p>
					<p>33. Byleve; stay; another form is "bleve;" from Anglo-Saxon, "belitan," to remain. Compare German, "bleiben."</p>
					<p>34. This sentiment, as well as the illustration of the bird which follows, is taken from the third book of Boethius, "De Consolatione Philosophiae," metrum 2. It has thus been rendered in Chaucer's translation: "All things seek aye to their proper course, and all things rejoice on their returning again to their nature."</p>
					<p>35. Men love of proper kind newfangleness: Men, by their own — their very — nature, are fond of novelty, and prone to inconstancy.</p>
					<p>36. Blue was the colour of truth, as green was that of inconstancy. In John Stowe's additions to Chaucer's works, printed in 1561, there is "A balade whiche Chaucer made against women inconstaunt," of which the refrain is, "In stead of blue, thus may ye wear all green."</p>
					<p>37. Unless we suppose this to be a namesake of the Camballo who was Canace's brother — which is not at all probable — we must agree with Tyrwhitt that there is a mistake here; which no doubt Chaucer would have rectified, if the tale had not been "left half-told," One manuscript reads "Caballo;" and though not much authority need be given to a difference that may be due to mere omission of the mark of contraction over the "a," there is enough in the text to show that another person than the king's younger son is intended. The Squire promises to tell the adventures that befell each member of Cambuscan's family; and in thorough consistency with this plan, and with the canons of chivalric story, would be "the marriage of Canace to some knight who was first obliged to fight for her with her two brethren; a method of courtship," adds Tyrwhitt, "very consonant to the spirit of ancient chivalry."</p>
					<p>38. (Trancriber's note) In some manuscripts the following two lines, being the beginning of the third part, are found: -</p>
					<p>Apollo whirleth up his chair so high, Till that Mercurius' house, the sly…</p>
