					<span>“In faith, Squier, thou hast thee well acquit,</span>

					<span>As to my doom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> there is none that is here</span>

					<span>Of eloquence that shall be thy peer,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Though it right now were fallen in my hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He were a man of such discretion</span>

					<span>As that ye be: fy on possession,</span>

					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> a man be virtuous withal.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
				<p>
					<span>In Armoric’, that called is Bretagne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was a knight, that lov’d and did his pain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To serve a lady in his beste wise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a labour, many a great emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He for his lady wrought, ere she were won:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was one the fairest under sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke thereto come of so high kindred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That well unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> durst this knight for dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell her his woe, his pain, and his distress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, at the last, she for his worthiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> for his meek obeisance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath such a pity caught of his penance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That privily she fell of his accord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take him for her husband and her lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Of such lordship as men have o’er their wives);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for to lead the more in bliss their lives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his free will he swore her as a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never in all his life he day nor night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should take upon himself no mastery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against her will, nor kithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> her jealousy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But her obey, and follow her will in all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any lover to his lady shall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that the name of sovereignety</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That would he have, for shame of his degree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She thanked him, and with full great humbless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saide; “Sir, since of your gentleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye proffer me to have so large a reign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne woulde God never betwixt us twain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in my guilt, were either war or strife:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir, I will be your humble true wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have here my troth, till that my hearte brest.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they both in quiet and in rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For one thing, Sires, safely dare I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That friends ever each other must obey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they will longe hold in company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love will not be constrain’d by mastery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When mast’ry comes, the god of love anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beateth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> his wings, and, farewell, he is gone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love is a thing as any spirit free.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Women of kind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> desire liberty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not to be constrained as a thrall,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so do men, if soothly I say shall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look who that is most patient in love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is at his advantage all above.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Patience is a high virtue certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it vanquisheth, as these clerkes sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinges that rigour never should attain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every word men may not chide or plain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Learne to suffer, or, so may I go,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall it learn whether ye will or no.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in this world certain no wight there is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he not doth or saith sometimes amiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ire, or sickness, or constellation,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wine, woe, or changing of complexion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Causeth full oft to do amiss or speaken:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On every wrong a man may not be wreaken.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> the time must be temperance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every wight that can of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> governance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore hath this worthy wise knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(To live in ease) sufferance her behight;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she to him full wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> gan to swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never should there be default in her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here may men see a humble wife accord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus hath she ta’en her servant and her lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Servant in love, and lord in marriage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was he both in lordship and servage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Servage? nay, but in lordship all above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since he had both his lady and his love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lady certes, and his wife also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which that law of love accordeth to.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he was in this prosperrity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home with his wife he went to his country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not far from Penmark,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> where his dwelling was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there he liv’d in bliss and in solace.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who coulde tell, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> he had wedded be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The joy, the ease, and the prosperity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is betwixt a husband and his wife?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A year and more lasted this blissful life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that this knight, of whom I spake thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of Cairrud<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> was call’d Arviragus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> him to go and dwell a year or twain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Engleland, that call’d was eke Britain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seek in armes worship and honour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For all his lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> he set in such labour);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dwelled there two years; the book saith thus.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now will I stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of this Arviragus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speak I will of Dorigen his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lov’d her husband as her hearte’s life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his absence weepeth she and siketh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As do these noble wives when them liketh;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She mourneth, waketh, waileth, fasteth, plaineth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desire of his presence her so distraineth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all this wide world she set at nought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her friendes, which that knew her heavy thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comforte her in all that ever they may;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They preache her, they tell her night and day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That causeless she slays herself, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every comfort possible in this case</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They do to her, with all their business,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all to make her leave her heaviness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By process, as ye knowen every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may so longe graven in a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till some figure therein imprinted be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long have they comforted her, till she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Received hath, by hope and by reason,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ imprinting of their consolation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through which her greate sorrow gan assuage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She may not always duren in such rage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke Arviragus, in all this care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath sent his letters home of his welfare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that he will come hastily again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles had this sorrow her hearty-slain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her friendes saw her sorrow gin to slake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed her on knees for Godde’s sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To come and roamen in their company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Away to drive her darke fantasy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finally she granted that request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well she saw that it was for the best.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now stood her castle faste by the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And often with her friendes walked she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her to disport upon the bank on high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as many a ship and barge sigh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sailing their courses, where them list to go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But then was that a parcel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> of her woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to herself full oft, “Alas!” said she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there no ship, of so many as I see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will bringe home my lord? then were my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All warish’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> of this bitter paine’s smart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another time would she sit and think,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast her eyen downward from the brink;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when she saw the grisly rockes blake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very fear so would her hearte quake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on her feet she might her not sustene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would she sit adown upon the green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And piteously into the sea behold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And say right thus, with careful sikes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> cold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Eternal God! that through thy purveyance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leadest this world by certain governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In idle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> as men say, ye nothing make;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Lord, these grisly fiendly rockes blake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That seem rather a foul confusion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of work, than any fair creation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such a perfect wise God and stable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why have ye wrought this work unreasonable?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by this work, north, south, or west, or east,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is not foster’d man, nor bird, nor beast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It doth no good, to my wit, but annoyeth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>See ye not, Lord, how mankind it destroyeth?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred thousand bodies of mankind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have rockes slain, all be they not in mind;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which mankind is so fair part of thy work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou madest it like to thine owen mark.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then seemed it ye had a great cherte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward mankind; but how then may it be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye such meanes make it to destroy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which meanes do no good, but ever annoy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well, clerkes will say as them lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By arguments, that all is for the best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although I can the causes not y-know;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> God that made the wind to blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As keep my lord, this is my conclusion:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To clerks leave I all disputation:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But would to God that all these rockes blake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were sunken into helle for his sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These rockes slay mine hearte for the fear.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus would she say, with many a piteous tear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her friendes saw that it was no disport</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To roame by the sea, but discomfort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shope them for to playe somewhere else.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They leade her by rivers and by wells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke in other places delectables;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They dancen, and they play at chess and tables.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So on a day, right in the morning-tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a garden that was there beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which that they had made their ordinance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of victual, and of other purveyance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They go and play them all the longe day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was on the sixth morrow of May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which May had painted with his softe showers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This garden full of leaves and of flowers:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And craft of manne’s hand so curiously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arrayed had this garden truely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never was there garden of such price,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if it were the very Paradise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’odour of flowers, and the freshe sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would have maked any hearte light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That e’er was born, but if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> too great sickness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or too great sorrow held it in distress;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So full it was of beauty and pleasance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after dinner they began to dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sing also, save Dorigen alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who made alway her complaint and her moan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she saw not him on the dance go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was her husband, and her love also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless she must a time abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with good hope let her sorrow slide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon this dance, amonge other men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Danced a squier before Dorigen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fresher was, and jollier of array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to my doom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> than is the month of May.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sang and danced, passing any man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is or was since that the world began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therewith he was, if men should him descrive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of the beste faring<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> men alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Young, strong, and virtuous, and rich, and wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well beloved, and holden in great price.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>

					<span>Unweeting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> of this Dorigen at all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This lusty squier, servant to Venus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that y-called was Aurelius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had lov’d her best of any creature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two year and more, as was his aventure;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But never durst he tell her his grievance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute cup he drank all his penance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was despaired, nothing durst he say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save in his songes somewhat would he wray<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His woe, as in a general complaining;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, he lov’d, and was belov’d nothing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of suche matter made he many lays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Songes, complaintes, roundels, virelays;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that he durste not his sorrow tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But languished, as doth a Fury in hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And die he must, he said, as did Echo</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Narcissus, that durst not tell her woe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In other manner than ye hear me say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He durste not to her his woe bewray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that paraventure sometimes at dances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where younge folke keep their observances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may well be he looked on her face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such a wise, as man that asketh grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But nothing wiste she of his intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nath’less it happen’d, ere they thennes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that he was her neighebour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was a man of worship and honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she had knowen him of time yore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They fell in speech, and forth aye more and more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his purpose drew Aurelius;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he saw his time, he saide thus:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Madam,” quoth he, “by God that this world made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that I wist it might your hearte glade,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would, that day that your Arviragus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went over sea, that I, Aurelius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had gone where I should never come again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well I wot my service is in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My guerdon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> is but bursting of mine heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Madame, rue upon my paine’s smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with a word ye may me slay or save.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here at your feet God would that I were grave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have now no leisure more to say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have mercy, sweet, or you will do me dey.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She gan to look upon Aurelius;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is this your will,” quoth she, “and say ye thus?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er erst,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> quoth she, “I wiste what ye meant:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now, Aurelius, I know your intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> God that gave me soul and life,</span>

					<span>I will be his to whom that I am knit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take this for final answer as of me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But after that in play<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> thus saide she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Aurelius,” quoth she, “by high God above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet will I grante you to be your love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Since I you see so piteously complain);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looke, what day that endelong<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> Bretagne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye remove all the rockes, stone by stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they not lette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> ship nor boat to gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, when ye have made this coast so clean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of rockes, that there is no stone seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will I love you best of any man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have here my troth, in all that ever I can;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well I wot that it shall ne’er betide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let such folly out of your hearte glide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What dainty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> should a man have in his life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to go love another manne’s wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath her body when that ever him liketh?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius full often sore siketh;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there none other grace in you?” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No, by that Lord,” quoth she, “that maked me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Woe was Aurelius when that he this heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with a sorrowful heart he thus answer’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Madame, quoth he, “this were an impossible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then must I die of sudden death horrible.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he turned him anon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then came her other friends many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the alleys roamed up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing wist of this conclusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But suddenly began to revel new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that the brighte sun had lost his hue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For th’ horizon had reft the sun his light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(This is as much to say as it was night);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And home they go in mirth and in solace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save only wretch’d Aurelius, alas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, he may not from his death astart.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him seemed, that he felt his hearte cold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to the heav’n his handes gan he hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his knees bare he set him down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his raving said his orisoun.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very woe out of his wit he braid;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wist not what he spake, but thus he said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With piteous heart his plaint hath he begun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the gods, and first unto the Sun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said; “Apollo God and governour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of every plante, herbe, tree, and flower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That giv’st, after thy declination,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To each of them his time and his season,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thine herberow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> changeth low and high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lord Phoebus: cast thy merciable<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On wretched Aurelius, which that am but lorn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, lord, my lady hath my death y-sworn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute guilt, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> thy benignity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my deadly heart have some pity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well I wot, Lord Phoebus, if you lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye may me helpe, save my lady, best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now vouchsafe, that I may you devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that I may be holp,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and in what wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your blissful sister, Lucina the sheen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of the sea is chief goddess and queen⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though Neptunus have deity in the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet emperess above him is she;⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye know well, lord, that, right as her desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is to be quick’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and lighted of your fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which she followeth you full busily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so the sea desireth naturally</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To follow her, as she that is goddess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both in the sea and rivers more and less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore, Lord Phoebus, this is my request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do this miracle, or do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> mine hearte brest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That flow, next at this opposition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which in the sign shall be of the Lion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As praye her so great a flood to bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That five fathom at least it overspring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The highest rock in Armoric Bretagne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let this flood endure yeares twain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then certes to my lady may I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Holde your hest,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> the rockes be away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lord Phoebus, this miracle do for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pray her she go no faster course than ye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say this, pray your sister that she go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No faster course than ye these yeares two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shall she be even at full alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spring-flood laste bothe night and day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but she<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> vouchesafe in such mannere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To grante me my sov’reign lady dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pray her to sink every rock adown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into her owen darke regioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the ground, where Pluto dwelleth in</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or nevermore shall I my lady win.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy temple in Delphos will I barefoot seek.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lord Phoebus! see the teares on my cheek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on my pain have some compassioun.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word in sorrow he fell down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And longe time he lay forth in a trance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His brother, which that knew of his penance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up caught him, and to bed he hath him brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Despaired in this torment and this thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let I this woeful creature lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choose he for me whe’er<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> he will live or die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Arviragus with health and great honour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As he that was of chivalry the flow’r)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is come home, and other worthy men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast thy lusty husband in thine arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The freshe knight, the worthy man of arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loveth thee as his own hearte’s life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing list him to be imaginatif<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any wight had spoke, while he was out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her of love; he had of that no doubt;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He not intended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> to no such mattere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But danced, jousted, and made merry cheer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of the sick Aurelius will I tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In languor and in torment furious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two year and more lay wretch’d Aurelius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere any foot on earth he mighte gon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor comfort in this time had he none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save of his brother, which that was a clerk.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew of all this woe and all this work;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to none other creature certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this matter he durst no worde sayn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his breast he bare it more secree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than e’er did Pamphilus for Galatee.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His breast was whole withoute for to seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in his heart aye was the arrow keen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well ye know that of a sursanure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In surgery is perilous the cure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> men might touch the arrow or come thereby.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His brother wept and wailed privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at the last him fell in remembrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That while he was at Orleans<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> in France⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As younge clerkes, that be likerous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To readen artes that be curious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeken in every halk and every hern<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Particular sciences for to learn⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He him remember’d, that upon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Orleans in study a book he say<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of magic natural, which his fellaw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was that time a bachelor of law</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> were he there to learn another craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had privily upon his desk y-laft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which book spake much of operations</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touching the eight and-twenty mansions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That longe to the Moon, and such folly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in our dayes is not worth a fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For holy church’s faith, in our believe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us suff’reth none illusion to grieve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this book was in his remembrance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon for joy his heart began to dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to himself he saide privily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My brother shall be warish’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> hastily:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> that there be sciences,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which men make divers apparences,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as these subtle tregetoures<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For oft at feaste’s have I well heard say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That tregetours, within a halle large,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have made come in a water and a barge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the halle rowen up and down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes hath seemed come a grim lioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes flowers spring as in a mead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes a vine, and grapes white and red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes a castle all of lime and stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, when them liked, voided<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> it anon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus seemed it to every manne’s sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now then conclude I thus; if that I might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Orleans some olde fellow find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath these Moone’s mansions in mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or other magic natural above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He should well make my brother have his love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with an appearance a clerk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> may make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To manne’s sight, that all the rockes blake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Bretagne were voided<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shippes by the brinke come and gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in such form endure a day or two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then were my brother warish’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> of his woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then must she needes holde her behest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles he shall shame her at the least.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I make a longer tale of this?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his brother’s bed he comen is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such comfort he gave him, for to gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Orleans, that he upstart anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his way forth-ward then is he fare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hope for to be lissed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> of his care.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When they were come almost to that city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if it were<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> a two furlong or three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A young clerk roaming by himself they met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that in Latin thriftily<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> them gret.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that he said a wondrous thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know,” quoth he, “the cause of your coming;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aud ere they farther any foote went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He told them all that was in their intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Breton clerk him asked of fellaws</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which he hadde known in olde daws,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he answer’d him that they deade were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he wept full often many a tear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down off his horse Aurelius light anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth with this magician is be gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home to his house, and made him well at ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them lacked no vitail that might them please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So well-array’d a house as there was one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius in his life saw never none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shewed him, ere they went to suppere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forestes, parkes, full of wilde deer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There saw he hartes with their hornes high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greatest that were ever seen with eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw of them an hundred slain with hounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some with arrows bleed of bitter wounds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw, when voided<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> were the wilde deer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These falconers upon a fair rivere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with their hawkes have the heron slain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then saw he knightes jousting in a plain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after this he did him such pleasance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he him shew’d his lady on a dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which himselfe danced, as him thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this master, that this magic wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw it was time, he clapp’d his handes two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And farewell, all the revel is y-go.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet remov’d they never out of the house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While they saw all the sightes marvellous;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in his study, where his bookes be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They satte still, and no wight but they three.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To him this master called his squier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said him thus, “May we go to supper?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almost an hour it is, I undertake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since I you bade our supper for to make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that these worthy men wente with me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into my study, where my bookes be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” quoth this squier, “when it liketh you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is all ready, though ye will right now.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go we then sup,” quoth he, “as for the best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These amorous folk some time must have rest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At after supper fell they in treaty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What summe should this master’s guerdon be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To remove all the rockes of Bretagne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke from Gironde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> to the mouth of Seine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made it strange,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> and swore, so God him save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less than a thousand pound he would not have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor gladly for that sum he would not gon.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius with blissful heart anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answered thus; “Fie on a thousand pound!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wide world, which that men say is round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would it give, if I were lord of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This bargain is full-driv’n, for we be knit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall be payed truly by my troth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But looke, for no negligence or sloth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye tarry us here no longer than to-morrow.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the clerk, “have here my faith to borrow.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bed is gone Aurelius when him lest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well-nigh all that night he had his rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What for his labour, and his hope of bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His woeful heart of penance had a liss.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon the morrow, when that it was day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto Bretagne they took the righte way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius and this magician beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be descended where they would abide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was, as the bookes me remember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The colde frosty season of December.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phoebus wax’d old, and hued like latoun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his hote declinatioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shone as the burned gold, with streames<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> bright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now in Capricorn adown he light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he shone full pale, I dare well sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bitter frostes, with the sleet and rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Destroyed have the green in every yard.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Janus sits by the fire with double beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drinketh of his bugle horn the wine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before him stands the brawn of tusked swine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And “nowel”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> crieth every lusty man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius, in all that ev’r he can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did to his master cheer and reverence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed him to do his diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bringe him out of his paines smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or with a sword that he would slit his heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This subtle clerk such ruth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> had on this man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That night and day he sped him, that he can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wait a time of his conclusion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, to make illusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By such an appearance of jugglery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I know no termes of astrology),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she and every wight should ween and say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of Bretagne the rockes were away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else they were sunken under ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So at the last he hath a time found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make his japes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> and his wretchedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such a superstitious cursedness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His tables Toletanes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> forth he brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full well corrected, that there lacked nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither his collect, nor his expanse years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither his rootes, nor his other gears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be his centres, and his arguments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his proportional convenients</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his equations in everything.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by his eighte spheres in his working,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew full well how far Alnath<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> was shove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the head of that fix’d Aries above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the ninthe sphere consider’d is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full subtilly he calcul’d all this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he had found his firste mansion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew the remnant by proportion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew the rising of his moone well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in whose face, and term, and every deal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew full well the moone’s mansion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accordant to his operation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew also his other observances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such illusions and such meschances,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As heathen folk used in thilke days.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which no longer made he delays;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through his magic, for a day or tway,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed all the rockes were away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Aurelius, which yet despaired is</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whe’er<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> he shall have his love, or fare amiss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awaited night and day on this miracle:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he knew that there was none obstacle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That voided<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> were these rockes every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down at his master’s feet he fell anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I, woeful wretch’d Aurelius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thank you, my Lord, and lady mine Venus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That me have holpen from my cares cold.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the temple his way forth hath he hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he knew he should his lady see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he saw his time, anon right he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With dreadful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> heart and with full humble cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saluteth hath his sovereign lady dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My rightful Lady,” quoth this woeful man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whom I most dread, and love as I best can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lothest were of all this world displease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were’t not that I for you have such disease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I must die here at your foot anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nought would I tell how me is woebegone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But certes either must I die or plain;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye slay me guilteless for very pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of my death though that ye have no ruth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Advise you, ere that ye break your truth:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Repente you, for thilke God above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere ye me slay because that I you love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, Madame, well ye wot what ye have hight;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that I challenge anything of right</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of you, my sovereign lady, but of grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in a garden yond’, in such a place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye wot right well what ye behighte me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in mine hand your trothe plighted ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To love me best; God wot ye saide so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that I unworthy am thereto;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Madame, I speak it for th’ honour of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than to save my hearte’s life right now;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have done so as ye commanded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if ye vouchesafe, ye may go see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do as you list, have your behest in mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, quick or dead, right there ye shall me find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In you hes all to do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> me live or dey;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But well I wot the rockes be away.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He took his leave, and she astonish’d stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all her face was not one drop of blood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She never ween’d t’have come in such a trap.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth she, “that ever this should hap!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ween’d I ne’er, by possibility,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That such a monster or marvail might be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is against the process of nature.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And home she went a sorrowful creature;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very fear unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> may she go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She weeped, wailed, all a day or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swooned, that it ruthe was to see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But why it was, to no wight tolde she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For out of town was gone Arviragus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to herself she spake, and saide thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With face pale, and full sorrowful cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her complaint, as ye shall after hear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth she, “on thee, Fortune, I plain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That unware hast me wrapped in thy chain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which to scape, wot I no succour,</span>

					<span>Save only death, or elles dishonour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of these two behoveth me to choose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, yet had I lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> lose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My life, than of my body have shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or know myselfe false, or lose my name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with my death I may be quit y-wis.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath there not many a noble wife, ere this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a maiden, slain herself, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rather than with her body do trespass?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yes, certes; lo, these stories bear witness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thirty tyrants full of cursedness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had slain Phidon in Athens at the feast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They commanded his daughters to arrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bringe them before them, in despite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All naked, to fulfil their foul delight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in their father’s blood they made them dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the pavement⁠—God give them mischance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which these woeful maidens, full of dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rather than they would lose their maidenhead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They privily be start<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> into a well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drowned themselves, as the bookes tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They of Messene let inquire and seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Lacedaemon fifty maidens eke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which they woulde do their lechery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there was none of all that company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was not slain, and with a glad intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chose rather for to die, than to assent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be oppressed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> of her maidenhead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I then to dien be in dread?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, eke the tyrant Aristoclides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lov’d a maiden hight Stimphalides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that her father slain was on a night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto Diana’s temple went she right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> the image in her handes two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which image she woulde never go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No wight her handes might off it arace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she was slain right in the selfe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now since that maidens hadde such despite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be defouled with man’s foul delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well ought a wife rather herself to sle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than be defouled, as it thinketh me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shall I say of Hasdrubale’s wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at Carthage bereft herself of life?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, when she saw the Romans win the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She took her children all, and skipt adown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the fire, and rather chose to die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than any Roman did her villainy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath not Lucretia slain herself, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Rome, when that she oppressed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Tarquin? for her thought it was a shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To live, when she hadde lost her name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The seven maidens of Milesie also</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have slain themselves for very dread and woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rather than folk of Gaul them should oppress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand stories, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could I now tell as touching this mattere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Abradate was slain, his wife so dear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Herselfe slew, and let her blood to glide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Abradate’s woundes, deep and wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, ‘My body at the leaste way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There shall no wight defoul, if that I may.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I more examples hereof sayn?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that so many have themselves slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well rather than they would defouled be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will conclude that it is bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> for me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slay myself, than be defouled thus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will be true unto Arviragus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles slay myself in some mannere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As did Demotione’s daughter dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because she woulde not defouled be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Sedasus, it is full great pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reade how thy daughters died, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That slew themselves for suche manner cas.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As great a pity was it, or well more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Theban maiden, that for Nicanor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Herselfe slew, right for such manner woe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another Theban maiden did right so;</span>

					<span>Thus plained Dorigen a day or tway,</span>

					<span>Purposing ever that she woulde dey;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>

					<span>But natheless upon the thirde night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home came Arviragus, the worthy knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked her why that she wept so sore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she gan weepen ever longer more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas,” quoth she, “that ever I was born!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus have I said,” quoth she; “thus have I sworn. “</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him all, as ye have heard before:</span>

					<span>It needeth not rehearse it you no more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This husband with glad cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> in friendly wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer’d and said, as I shall you devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is there aught elles, Dorigen, but this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, nay,” quoth she, “God help me so, as wis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is too much, an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> it were Godde’s will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, wife,” quoth he, “let sleepe what is still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be well par’venture yet to-day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall your trothe holde, by my fay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God so wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> have mercy on me,</span>

					<span>I had well lever sticked for to be,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>

					<span>For very love which I to you have,</span>

					<span>But if ye should your trothe keep and save.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truth is the highest thing that man may keep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with that word he burst anon to weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I you forbid, on pain of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never, while you lasteth life or breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To no wight tell ye this misaventure;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nor make no countenance of heaviness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That folk of you may deeme harm, or guess.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he call’d a squier and a maid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go forth anon with Dorigen,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And bringe her to such a place anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They take their leave, and on their way they gon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But they not wiste why she thither went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would to no wight telle his intent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This squier, which that hight Aurelius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Dorigen that was so amorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of aventure happen’d her to meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid the town, right in the quickest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> street,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she was bound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> to go the way forthright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the garden, there as she had hight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he was to the garden-ward also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well he spied when she woulde go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of her house, to any manner place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thus they met, of aventure or grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he saluted her with glad intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked of her whitherward she went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she answered, half as she were mad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Unto the garden, as my husband bade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trothe for to hold, alas! alas!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius gan to wonder on this case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his heart had great compassion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her, and of her lamentation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of Arviragus, the worthy knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bade her hold all that she hadde hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So loth him was his wife should break her truth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his heart he caught of it great ruth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Considering the best on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from his lust yet were him lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than do so high a churlish wretchedness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against franchise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and alle gentleness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which in fewe words he saide thus;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Madame, say to your lord Arviragus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That since I see the greate gentleness</span>

					<span>That him were lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> have shame (and that were ruth)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>

					<span>Than to depart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> the love betwixt you two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I you release, Madame, into your hond,</span>

					<span>That ye have made to me as herebeforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since thilke time that ye were born.</span>

					<span>Have here my truth, I shall you ne’er repreve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of no behest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> and here I take my leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of the truest and the beste wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever yet I knew in all my life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But every wife beware of her behest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Dorigen remember at the least.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus can a squier do a gentle deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well as can a knight, withoute drede.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She thanked him upon her knees bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And home unto her husband is she fare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him all, as ye have hearde said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, truste me, he was so well apaid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it were impossible me to write.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I longer of this case indite?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arviragus and Dorigen his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sov’reign blisse ledde forth their life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er after was there anger them between;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cherish’d her as though she were a queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she was to him true for evermore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of these two folk ye get of me no more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Aurelius, that his cost had all forlorn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cursed the time that ever he was born.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “alas that I behight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of pured<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> gold a thousand pound of weight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To this philosopher! how shall I do?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see no more, but that I am fordo.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>

					<span>At certain dayes year by year to pay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thank him of his greate courtesy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trothe will I keep, I will not he.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With hearte sore he went unto his coffer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And broughte gold unto this philosopher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The value of five hundred pound, I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him beseeched, of his gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To grant him dayes of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> the remenant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Master, I dare well make avaunt,</span>

					<span>Then were I well, for elles must I sell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine heritage; there is no more to tell.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This philosopher soberly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> answer’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide thus, when he these wordes heard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Have I not holden covenant to thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes, certes, well and truely,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hast thou not had thy lady as thee liked?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No, no,” quoth he, and sorrowfully siked.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What was the cause? tell me if thou can.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurelius his tale anon began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him all as ye have heard before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It needeth not to you rehearse it more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, “Arviragus of gentleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> die in sorrow and distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that his wife were of her trothe false.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sorrow of Dorigen he told him als’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How loth her was to be a wicked wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that she lever had lost that day her life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that her troth she swore through innocence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She ne’er erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> had heard speak of apparence;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made me have of her so great pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right as freely as he sent her to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As freely sent I her to him again:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is all and some, there is no more to sayn.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The philosopher answer’d; “Leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Evereach of you did gently to the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art a squier, and he is a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But God forbidde, for his blissful might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if a clerk could do a gentle deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well as any of you, it is no drede.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir, I release thee thy thousand pound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thou right now were crept out of the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ever ere now haddest knowen me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, Sir, I will not take a penny of thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all my craft, nor naught for my travail;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast y-payed well for my vitaille;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is enough; and farewell, have good day.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took his horse, and forth he went his way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lordings, this question would I aske now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which was the moste free,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> as thinketh you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now telle me, ere that ye farther wend.</span>
