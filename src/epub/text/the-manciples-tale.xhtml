					<span>Weet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> ye not where there stands a little town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that y-called is Bob-up-and-down,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the Blee, in Canterbury way?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There gan our Hoste for to jape and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide, "Sirs, what? Dun is in the mire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there no man, for prayer nor for hire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That will awaken our fellow behind?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thief him might full lightly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> rob and bind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how he nappeth, see, for cocke's bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he would falle from his horse at ones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is that a Cook of London,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> with mischance?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> him come forth, he knoweth his penance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he shall tell a tale, by my fay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although it be not worth a bottle hay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Awake, thou Cook," quoth he; "God give thee sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What aileth thee to sleepe by the morrow?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast thou had fleas all night, or art drunk?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or had thou with some quean all night y-swunk,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that thou mayest not hold up thine head?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Cook, that was full pale and nothing red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said to Host, "So God my soule bless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As there is fall'n on me such heaviness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know not why, that me were lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than the best gallon wine that is in Cheap."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Well," quoth the Manciple, "if it may do ease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thee, Sir Cook, and to no wight displease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that here rideth in this company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that our Host will of his courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will as now excuse thee of thy tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in good faith thy visage is full pale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine eyen daze,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> soothly as me thinketh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well I wot, thy breath full soure stinketh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That sheweth well thou art not well disposed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of me certain thou shalt not be y-glosed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how he yawneth, lo, this drunken wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As though he would us swallow anon right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hold close thy mouth, man, by thy father's kin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil of helle set his foot therein!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy cursed breath infecte will us all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fy! stinking swine, fy! foul may thee befall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! take heed, Sirs, of this lusty man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, sweete Sir, will ye joust at the fan?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto, me thinketh, ye be well y-shape.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow that ye have drunken wine of ape,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that is when men playe with a straw."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And with this speech the Cook waxed all wraw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the Manciple he gan nod fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For lack of speech; and down his horse him cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he lay, till that men him up took.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was a fair chevachie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> of a cook:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! that he had held him by his ladle!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere that he again were in the saddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was great shoving bothe to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lift him up, and muche care and woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So unwieldy was this silly paled ghost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the Manciple then spake our Host:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Because that drink hath domination</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this man, by my salvation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow he lewedly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> will tell his tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For were it wine, or old or moisty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he hath drunk, he speaketh in his nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sneezeth fast, and eke he hath the pose.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He also hath to do more than enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep him on his capel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> out of the slough;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he fall from off his capel eftsoon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shall we alle have enough to do'n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In lifting up his heavy drunken corse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell on thy tale, of him make I no force.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet, Manciple, in faith thou art too nice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus openly to reprove him of his vice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another day he will paraventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reclaime thee, and bring thee to the lure;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean, he speake will of smalle things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to pinchen at<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> thy reckonings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were not honest, if it came to prefe."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth the Manciple, "That were a great mischief;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So might he lightly bring me in the snare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet had I lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> paye for the mare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he rides on, than he should with me strive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not wrathe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> him, so may I thrive)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That that I spake, I said it in my bourde.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weet ye what? I have here in my gourd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A draught of wine, yea, of a ripe grape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon ye shall see a good jape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Cook shall drink thereof, if that I may;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On pain of my life he will not say nay."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certainly, to tellen as it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this vessel the cook drank fast (alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What needed it? he drank enough beforn),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he hadde pouped in his horn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the Manciple he took the gourd again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of that drink the Cook was wondrous fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thanked him in such wise as he could.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan our Host to laughe wondrous loud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, "I see well it is necessary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where that we go good drink with us to carry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that will turne rancour and disease<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>T'accord and love, and many a wrong appease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Bacchus, Bacchus, blessed be thy name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That so canst turnen earnest into game!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Worship and thank be to thy deity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that mattere ye get no more of me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell on thy tale, Manciple, I thee pray."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Well, Sir," quoth he, "now hearken what I say."</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></h3>
				<p>
					<span>When Phoebus dwelled here in earth adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As olde bookes make mentioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was the moste lusty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> bacheler</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all this world, and eke the best archer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He slew Python the serpent, as he lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleeping against the sun upon a day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many another noble worthy deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He with his bow wrought, as men maye read.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Playen he could on every minstrelsy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And singe, that it was a melody</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hearen of his cleare voice the soun'.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with his singing walled the city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could never singe half so well as he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto he was the seemlieste man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is, or was since that the world began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What needeth it his features to descrive?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in this world is none so fair alive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was therewith full fill'd of gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of honour, and of perfect worthiness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Phoebus, that was flower of bach'lery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well in freedom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> as in chivalry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his disport, in sign eke of victory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Python, so as telleth us the story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was wont to bearen in his hand a bow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which in a cage he foster'd many a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And counterfeit the speech of every man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therewith in all this world no nightingale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singe so wondrous merrily and well.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that he loved more than his life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And night and day did ever his diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her for to please, and do her reverence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For him were loth y-japed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> for to be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so is every wight in such degree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all for nought, for it availeth nought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should not be kept in none await<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> certain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truely the labour is in vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep a shrewe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> for it will not be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This hold I for a very nicety,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To spille<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> labour for to keepe wives;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus writen olde clerkes in their lives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now to purpose, as I first began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This worthy Phoebus did all that he can</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To please her, weening, through such pleasance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for his manhood and his governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no man should have put him from her grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, God it wot, there may no man embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to distrain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> a thing, which that nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath naturally set in a creature.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take any bird, and put it in a cage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And do all thine intent, and thy corage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To foster it tenderly with meat and drink</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of alle dainties that thou canst bethink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keep it all so cleanly as thou may;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although the cage of gold be never so gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet had this bird, by twenty thousand fold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> in a forest, both wild and cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go eate wormes, and such wretchedness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever this bird will do his business</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T'escape out of his cage when that he may:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His liberty the bird desireth aye.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let take a cat, and foster her with milk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tender flesh, and make her couch of silk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let her see a mouse go by the wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon she weiveth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> milk, and flesh, and all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every dainty that is in that house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such appetite hath she to eat the mouse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, here hath kind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> her domination,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And appetite flemeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> discretion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A she-wolf hath also a villain's kind;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lewedeste wolf that she may find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or least of reputation, will she take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In time when her lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> to have a make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these examples speak I by<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> these men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That be untrue, and nothing by women.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For men have ever a lik'rous appetite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On lower things to perform their delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than on their wives, be they never so fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never so true, nor so debonair.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flesh is so newefangled, with mischance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we can in no thinge have pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That souneth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> unto virtue any while.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Phoebus, which that thought upon no guile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deceived was for all his jollity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For under him another hadde she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man of little reputation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nought worth to Phoebus in comparison.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more harm is; it happens often so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which there cometh muche harm and woe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife anon hath for her leman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her leman! certes that is a knavish speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wise Plato saith, as ye may read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The word must needs accorde with the deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If men shall telle properly a thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The word must cousin be to the working.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a boistous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> man, right thus I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no difference truely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt a wife that is of high degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(If of her body dishonest she be),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And any poore wench, other than this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(If it so be they worke both amiss),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> the gentle is in estate above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shall be call'd his lady and his love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for that other is a poor woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shall be call'd his wench and his leman:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God it wot, mine owen deare brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men lay the one as low as lies the other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so betwixt a titleless tyrant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And an outlaw, or else a thief errant,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same I say, there is no difference</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(To Alexander told was this sentence),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for the tyrant is of greater might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By force of meinie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> for to slay downright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And burn both house and home, and make all plain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, therefore is he call'd a capitain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And may not do so great an harm as he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor bring a country to so great mischief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men calle him an outlaw or a thief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for I am a man not textuel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not tell of texts never a deal;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go to my tale, as I began.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Phoebus' wife had sent for her leman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon they wroughten all their lust volage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This white crow, that hung aye in the cage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beheld their work, and said never a word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that home was come Phoebus the lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This crowe sung, "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"What? bird," quoth Phoebus, "what song sing'st thou now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wert thou not wont so merrily to sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to my heart it was a rejoicing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hear thy voice? alas! what song is this?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"By God," quoth he, "I singe not amiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phoebus," quoth he, "for all thy worthiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all thy beauty, and all thy gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all thy song, and all thy minstrelsy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all thy waiting,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> bleared is thine eye<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With one of little reputation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not worth to thee, as in comparison,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mountance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> of a gnat, so may I thrive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For on thy bed thy wife I saw him swive."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What will ye more? the crow anon him told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By sade<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> tokens, and by wordes bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that his wife had done her lechery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his great shame and his great villainy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him oft, he saw it with his eyen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Phoebus gan awayward for to wrien;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him thought his woeful hearte burst in two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bow he bent, and set therein a flo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his ire he hath his wife slain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is th' effect, there is no more to sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sorrow of which he brake his minstrelsy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both harp and lute, gitern<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and psaltery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke he brake his arrows and his bow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that thus spake he to the crow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"Traitor," quoth he, "with tongue of scorpion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast me brought to my confusion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas that I was wrought!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> why n'ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> I dead?</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That wert to me so sad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> and eke so true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now liest thou dead, with face pale of hue,</span>

					<span>O rakel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> hand, to do so foul amiss!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O troubled wit, O ire reckeless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That unadvised smit'st the guilteless!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O wantrust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> full of false suspicion!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where was thy wit and thy discretion?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O! every man beware of rakelness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a> no thing withoute strong witness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smite not too soon, ere that ye weete<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> why,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be advised<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a> well and sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere ye do any execution</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon your ire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">39</a> for suspicion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! a thousand folk hath rakel ire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Foully fordone, and brought them in the mire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! for sorrow I will myself sle."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the crow, "O false thief," said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"I will thee quite anon thy false tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou sung whilom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> like any nightingale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now shalt thou, false thief, thy song foregon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke thy white feathers every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ever in all thy life shalt thou speak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus shall men on a traitor be awreak.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou and thine offspring ever shall be blake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ever sweete noise shall ye make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ever cry against<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> tempest and rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In token that through thee my wife is slain."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the crow he start,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> and that anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pull'd his white feathers every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made him black, and reft him all his song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke his speech, and out at door him flung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the devil, which I him betake;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for this cause be all crowes blake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lordings, by this ensample, I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware, and take keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> what that ye say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor telle never man in all your life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that another man hath dight his wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He will you hate mortally certain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan Solomon, as wise clerkes sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Teacheth a man to keep his tongue well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, as I said, I am not textuel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless thus taughte me my dame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"My son, think on the crow, in Godde's name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, keep well thy tongue, and keep thy friend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wicked tongue is worse than is a fiend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sone, from a fiend men may them bless.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, God of his endeless goodness themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walled a tongue with teeth, and lippes eke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> man should him advise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> what he speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, full often for too muche speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath many a man been spilt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> as clerkes teach;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for a little speech advisedly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is no man shent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> to speak generally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, thy tongue shouldest thou restrain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At alle time, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> when thou dost thy pain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak of God in honour and prayere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The firste virtue, son, if thou wilt lear,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is to restrain and keepe well thy tongue;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus learne children, when that they be young.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, of muche speaking evil advis'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where lesse speaking had enough suffic'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cometh much harm; thus was me told and taught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In muche speeche sinne wanteth not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> thou whereof a rakel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> tongue serveth?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as a sword forcutteth and forcarveth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An arm in two, my deare son, right so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tongue cutteth friendship all in two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A jangler<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> is to God abominable.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read Solomon, so wise and honourable;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read David in his Psalms, and read Senec'.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, speak not, but with thine head thou beck,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dissimule as thou wert<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> deaf, if that thou hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A jangler speak of perilous mattere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Fleming saith, and learn if that thee lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That little jangling causeth muche rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, if thou no wicked word hast said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee thar not dreade<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> for to be bewray'd;</span>

					<span>But he that hath missaid, I dare well sayn,</span>
