					<span>The Cook of London, while the Reeve thus spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For joy he laugh'd and clapp'd him on the back:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Aha!" quoth he, "for Christes passion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Miller had a sharp conclusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this argument of herbergage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well saide Solomon in his language,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bring thou not every man into thine house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For harbouring by night is perilous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well ought a man avised for to be<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom that he brought into his privity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God to give me sorrow and care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If ever, since I highte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> Hodge of Ware,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He had a jape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of malice in the derk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But God forbid that we should stinte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore if ye will vouchsafe to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tale of me, that am a poore man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you tell as well as e'er I can</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little jape that fell in our city."</span>

				<p>
					<span>Our Host answer'd and said; "I grant it thee.</span>

					<span>Roger, tell on; and look that it be good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For many a pasty hast thou letten blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a Jack of Dover<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> hast thou sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had been twice hot and twice cold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christe's curse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of thy parsley yet fare they the worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they have eaten in thy stubble goose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in thy shop doth many a fly go loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now tell on, gentle Roger, by thy name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet I pray thee be not wroth for game;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man may say full sooth in game and play."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Thou sayst full sooth," quoth Roger, "by my fay;</span>

					<span>But sooth play quad play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> as the Fleming saith,</span>

					<span>Be thou not wroth, else we departe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> here,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal he laugh'd and made cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A prentice whilom dwelt in our city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of a craft of victuallers was he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Galliard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> he was, as goldfinch in the shaw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brown as a berry, a proper short fellaw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lockes black, combed full fetisly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dance he could so well and jollily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was called Perkin Revellour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was as full of love and paramour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is the honeycomb of honey sweet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well was the wenche that with him might meet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every bridal would he sing and hop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He better lov'd the tavern than the shop.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when there any riding was in Cheap,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the shoppe thither would he leap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, till that he had all the sight y-seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And danced well, he would not come again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gather'd him a meinie of his sort,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hop and sing, and make such disport:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there they sette steven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> for to meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To playen at the dice in such a street.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in the towne was there no prentice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fairer coulde cast a pair of dice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than Perkin could; and thereto he was free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his dispence, in place of privity.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That found his master well in his chaffare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For oftentime he found his box full bare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, soothely, a prentice revellour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That haunteth dice, riot, and paramour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His master shall it in his shop abie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> have he no part of the minstrelsy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For theft and riot they be convertible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> can they play on gitern or ribible.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Revel and truth, as in a low degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be full wroth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> all day, as men may see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This jolly prentice with his master bode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he was nigh out of his prenticehood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> were he snubbed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> both early and late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes led with revel to Newgate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last his master him bethought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a day when he his paper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a proverb, that saith this same word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better is rotten apple out of hoard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that it should rot all the remenant:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fares it by a riotous servant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is well lesse harm to let him pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than he shend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> all the servants in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore his master gave him a quittance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade him go, with sorrow and mischance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus this jolly prentice had his leve:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let him riot all the night, or leave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, for there is no thief without a louke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That helpeth him to wasten and to souk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that he bribe can, or borrow may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon he sent his bed and his array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a compere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> of his owen sort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loved dice, and riot, and disport;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had a wife, that held for countenance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shop, and swived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> for her sustenance.</span>
