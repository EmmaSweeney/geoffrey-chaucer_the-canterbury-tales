					<span>“Weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow,</span>

					<span>I have enough, on even and on morrow,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth the Merchant, “and so have other mo’,</span>

					<span>That wedded be; I trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> that it be so;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well I wot it fareth so by me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have a wife, the worste that may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though the fiend to her y-coupled were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She would him overmatch, I dare well swear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I you rehearse in special</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her high malice? she is a shrew at all.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is a long and large difference</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt Griselda’s greate patience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of my wife the passing cruelty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were I unbounden, all so may I the,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I woulde never eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> come in the snare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We wedded men live in sorrow and care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assay it whoso will, and he shall find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I say sooth, by Saint Thomas of Ind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for the more part; I say not all⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God shielde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> that it shoulde so befall.</span>

					<span>Ah! good Sir Host, I have y-wedded be</span>

					<span>These moneths two, and more not, pardie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet I trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> that he that all his life</span>

					<span>Wifeless hath been, though that men would him rive</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></h3>
				<p>
					<span>Whilom there was dwelling in Lombardy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A worthy knight, that born was at Pavie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which he liv’d in great prosperity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forty years a wifeless man was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And follow’d aye his bodily delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On women, where as was his appetite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As do these fooles that be seculeres.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, when that he was passed sixty years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were it for holiness, or for dotage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot say, but such a great corage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hadde this knight to be a wedded man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That day and night he did all that he can</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To espy where that he might wedded be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Praying our Lord to grante him, that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mighte once knowen of that blissful life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is betwixt a husband and his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to live under that holy bond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which God firste man and woman bond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“None other life,” said he, “is worth a bean;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wedlock is so easy, and so clean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in this world it is a paradise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus said this olde knight, that was so wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certainly, as sooth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> as God is king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take a wife it is a glorious thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> when a man is old and hoar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then is a wife the fruit of his treasor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then should he take a young wife and a fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which he might engender him an heir,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lead his life in joy and in solace;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereas these bachelors singen “Alas!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that they find any adversity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In love, which is but childish vanity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truely it sits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> well to be so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bachelors have often pain and woe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On brittle ground they build, and brittleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They finde when they weene sickerness:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They live but as a bird or as a beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In liberty, and under no arrest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereas a wedded man in his estate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Liveth a life blissful and ordinate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the yoke of marriage y-bound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For who can be so buxom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> as a wife?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is so true, and eke so attentive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> him, sick and whole, as is his make?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For weal or woe she will him not forsake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is not weary him to love and serve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he lie bedrid until he sterve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet some clerkes say it is not so;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which he, Theophrast, is one of tho:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What force<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> though Theophrast list for to lie?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Take no wife,” quoth he, “for husbandry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to spare in household thy dispence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A true servant doth more diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy good to keep, than doth thine owen wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she will claim a half part all her life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that thou be sick, so God me save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy very friendes, or a true knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will keep thee bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> than she, that waiteth aye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> thy good, and hath done many a day.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sentence, and a hundred times worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Writeth this man, there God his bones curse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But take no keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of all such vanity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Defy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> Theophrast, and hearken to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A wife is Godde’s gifte verily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All other manner giftes hardily,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As handes, rentes, pasture, or commune,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or mebles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> all be giftes of fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That passen as a shadow on the wall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But dread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> thou not, if plainly speak I shall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife will last, and in thine house endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well longer than thee list, paraventure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marriage is a full great sacrament;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He which that hath no wife, I hold him shent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He liveth helpless, and all desolate</span>

					<span>(I speak of folk in secular estate):<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hearken why, I say not this for nought⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That woman is for manne’s help y-wrought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The highe God, when he had Adam maked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw him all alone belly naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God of his greate goodness saide then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us now make a help unto this man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to himself; and then he made him Eve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here may ye see, and hereby may ye preve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a wife is man s help and his comfort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His paradise terrestre and his disport.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So buxom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> and so virtuous is she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They muste needes live in unity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One flesh they be, and one blood, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With but one heart in weal and in distress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife? Ah! Saint Mary, <i>ben’dicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How might a man have any adversity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath a wife? certes I cannot say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bliss the which that is betwixt them tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There may no tongue it tell, or hearte think.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he be poor, she helpeth him to swink;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She keeps his good, and wasteth never a deal;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that her husband list, her liketh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saith not ones Nay, when he saith Yea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Do this,” saith he; “All ready, Sir,” saith she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O blissful order, wedlock precious!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art so merry, and eke so virtuous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so commended and approved eke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every man that holds him worth a leek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his bare knees ought all his life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thank his God, that him hath sent a wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles pray to God him for to send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife, to last unto his life’s end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For then his life is set in sickerness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He may not be deceived, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that he work after his wife’s rede;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then may he boldely bear up his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be so true, and therewithal so wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, if thou wilt worken as the wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do alway so as women will thee rede.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>

					<span>Lo how that Jacob, as these clerkes read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By good counsel of his mother Rebecc’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bounde the kiddes skin about his neck;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which his father’s benison<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> he wan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo Judith, as the story telle can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By good counsel she Godde’s people kept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And slew him, Holofernes, while he slept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo Abigail, by good counsel, how she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saved her husband Nabal, when that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should have been slain. And lo, Esther also</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By counsel good deliver’d out of woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people of God, and made him, Mardoche,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Assuere enhanced<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> for to be.</span>

					<span>There is nothing in gree superlative<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

					<span>(As saith Senec) above a humble wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffer thy wife’s tongue, as Cato bit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shall command, and thou shalt suffer it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet she will obey of courtesy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife is keeper of thine husbandry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may the sicke man bewail and weep,</span>

					<span>There as there is no wife the house to keep.</span>

					<span>I warne thee, if wisely thou wilt wirch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>

					<span>No man hateth his flesh, but in his life</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of worldly folk holde the sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be so knit there may no harm betide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> upon the wife’s side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For which this January, of whom I told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consider’d hath within his dayes old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lusty life, the virtuous quiet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is in marriage honey-sweet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for his friends upon a day he sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell them the effect of his intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With face sad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> his tale he hath them told:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Upon my soule somewhat must I think.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have my body foolishly dispended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessed be God that it shall be amended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will be certain a wedded man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that anon in all the haste I can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto some maiden, fair and tender of age;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you shape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> for my marriage</span>

					<span>Than I, and where me best were to ally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one thing warn I you, my friendes dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will none old wife have in no mannere:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shall not passe sixteen year certain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old fish and younge flesh would I have fain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better,” quoth he, “a pike than a pickerel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And better than old beef is tender veal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will no woman thirty year of age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is but beanestraw and great forage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke these olde widows (God it wot)</span>

					<span>They conne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> so much craft on Wade’s boat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>That with them should I never live in rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sundry schooles make subtle clerkes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Woman of many schooles half a clerk is.</span>

					<span>Wherefore I say you plainly in a clause,</span>

					<span>That I in her could have no pleasance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then should I lead my life in avoutrie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>

					<span>And go straight to the devil when I die.</span>

					<span>Men shoulde wed: and farthermore know I</span>

					<span>There speaketh many a man of marriage</span>

					<span>That knows no more of it than doth my page,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what causes a man should take a wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he ne may not live chaste his life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take him a wife with great devotion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of lawful procreation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of children, to th’ honour of God above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not only for paramour or love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for they shoulde lechery eschew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yield their debte when that it is due:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or for that each of them should help the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mischief,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> as a sister shall the brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And live in chastity full holily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sires, by your leave, that am not I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God be thanked, I dare make avaunt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I feel my limbes stark<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and suffisant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do all that a man belongeth to:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot myselfe best what I may do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I be hoar, I fare as doth a tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That blossoms ere the fruit y-waxen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blossomy tree is neither dry nor dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I feel me now here hoar but on my head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine heart and all my limbes are as green</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As laurel through the year is for to seen.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, since that ye have heard all mine intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you to my will ye would assent.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Diverse men diversely him told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of marriage many examples old;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some blamed it, some praised it, certain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the haste, shortly for to sayn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As all day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> falleth altercation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixte friends in disputation),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There fell a strife betwixt his brethren two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which that one was called Placebo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Justinus soothly called was that other.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Placebo said; “O January, brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full little need have ye, my lord so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Counsel to ask of any that is here:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that ye be so full of sapience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you not liketh, for your high prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To waive<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> from the word of Solomon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This word said he unto us every one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Work alle thing by counsel⁠—thus said he⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thenne shalt thou not repente thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But though that Solomon spake such a word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine owen deare brother and my lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> God my soule bring at rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hold your owen counsel is the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, brother mine, take of me this motive;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have now been a court-man all my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, God it wot, though I unworthy be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have standen in full great degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboute lordes of full high estate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet had I ne’er with none of them debate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never them contraried truely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know well that my lord can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> more than I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What that he saith I hold it firm and stable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say the same, or else a thing semblable.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A full great fool is any counsellor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That serveth any lord of high honour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dare presume, or ones thinken it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That his counsel should pass his lorde’s wit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, lordes be no fooles by my fay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have yourselfe shewed here to day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So high sentence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> so holily and well,</span>

					<span>By God, there is no man in all this town</span>

					<span>Nor in Itale, could better have y-said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Christ holds him of this counsel well apaid.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truely it is a high courage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of any man that stopen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> is in age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take a young wife, by my father’s kin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your hearte hangeth on a jolly pin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do now in this matter right as you lest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For finally I hold it for the best.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Justinus, that aye stille sat and heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right in this wise to Placebo answer’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, brother mine, be patient I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since ye have said, and hearken what I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Senec, among his other wordes wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saith, that a man ought him right well advise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom he gives his hand or his chattel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since I ought advise me right well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom I give my good away from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well more I ought advise me, pardie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom I give my body: for alway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn you well it is no childe’s play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take a wife without advisement.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men must inquire (this is mine assent)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whe’er she be wise, or sober, or dronkelew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or proud, or any other ways a shrew,</span>

					<span>None in this world, that trotteth whole in all,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No man, nor beast, such as men can devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But nathehess it ought enough suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With any wife, if so were that she had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More goode thewes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> than her vices bad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all this asketh leisure to inquere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God it wot, I have wept many a tear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily, since I have had a wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Praise whoso will a wedded manne’s life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes, I find in it but cost and care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And observances of all blisses bare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, God wot, my neighebours about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> of women many a rout,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>

					<span>Ye may for me right as you like do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Advise you, ye be a man of age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that ye enter into marriage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> with a young wife and a fair,</span>

					<span>Is busy enough to bringen it about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have his wife alone, truste me:</span>

					<span>Ye shall not please her fully yeares three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, to do her full pleasance.</span>

					<span>“Well,” quoth this January, “and hast thou said?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straw for thy Senec, and for thy proverbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I counte not a pannier full of herbs</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>High fantasy and curious business</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day gan in the soul impress<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of January about his marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a fair shape, and many a fair visage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There passed through his hearte night by night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As whoso took a mirror polish’d bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set it in a common market-place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then should he see many a figure pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By his mirror; and in the same wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan January in his thought devise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of maidens, which that dwelte him beside:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wiste not where that he might abide.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if that one had beauty in her face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another stood so in the people’s grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For her sadness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> and her benignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of the people greatest voice had she:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some were rich and had a badde name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, betwixt earnest and game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He at the last appointed him on one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let all others from his hearte gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chose her of his own authority;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For love is blind all day, and may not see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he was into bed y-brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He pourtray’d in his heart and in his thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her freshe beauty, and her age tender,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her middle small, her armes long and slender,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her wise governance, her gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her womanly bearing, and her sadness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he on her was condescended,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought his choice might not be amended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when that he himself concluded had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought each other manne’ s wit so bad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That impossible it were to reply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against his choice; this was his fantasy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His friendes sent he to, at his instance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed them to do him that pleasance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hastily they would unto him come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would abridge their labour all and some:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Needed no more for them to go nor ride,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>And alderfirst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> he bade them all a boon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none of them no arguments would make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the purpose that he had y-take:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which purpose was pleasant to God, said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And very ground of his prosperity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, there was a maiden in the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that of beauty hadde great renown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> were it so she were of small degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sufficed him her youth and her beauty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which maid, he said, he would have to his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lead in ease and holiness his life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thanked God, that he might have her all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no wight with his blisse parte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> shall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed them to labour in this need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shape that he faile not to speed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For then, he said, his spirit was at ease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Then is,” quoth he, “nothing may me displease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save one thing pricketh in my conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which I will rehearse in your presence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have,” quoth he, “heard said, full yore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> ago,</span>

					<span>There may no man have perfect blisses two,</span>

					<span>This is to say, on earth and eke in heaven.</span>

					<span>And eke from every branch of thilke tree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet is there so perfect felicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so great ease and lust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in marriage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ev’r I am aghast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> now in mine age</span>

				<p>
					<span>Justinus, which that hated his folly,</span>

					<span>He woulde no authority<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> allege,</span>

					<span>But saide; “Sir, so there be none obstacle</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That, ere ye have your rights of holy church,</span>

					<span>Ye may repent of wedded manne’s life,</span>

					<span>In which ye say there is no woe nor strife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And elles God forbid, but if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> he sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wedded man his grace him to repent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well often, rather than a single man.</span>

					<span>That there is none so great felicity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In marriage, nor ever more shall be,</span>

					<span>That you shall let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> of your salvation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that ye use, as skill is and reason,</span>

					<span>That to the churche bothe be they went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to receive the holy sacrament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth came the priest, with stole about his neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade her be like Sarah and Rebecc’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In wisdom and in truth of marriage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said his orisons, as is usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crouched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> them, and bade<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> God should them bless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made all sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> enough with holiness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus be they wedded with solemnity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the feaste sat both he and she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With other worthy folk, upon the dais.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All full of joy and bliss is the palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And full of instruments, and of vitaille,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moste dainteous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> of all Itale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before them stood such instruments of soun’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Orpheus, nor of Thebes Amphioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne made never such a melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every course came in loud minstrelsy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never Joab trumped for to hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor he, Theodomas, yet half so clear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Thebes, when the city was in doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bacchus the wine them skinked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> all about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Venus laughed upon every wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For January was become her knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And woulde both assaye his courage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In liberty, and eke in marriage),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her firebrand in her hand about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Danced before the bride and all the rout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certainly I dare right well say this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hymeneus, that god of wedding is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw never his life so merry a wedded man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hold thou thy peace, thou poet Marcian,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That writest us that ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> wedding merry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her Philology and him Mercury,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of the songes that the Muses sung;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too small is both thy pen, and eke thy tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to describen of this marriage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When tender youth hath wedded stooping age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is such mirth that it may not be writ;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assay it youreself, then may ye wit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that I lie or no in this mattere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Maius, that sat with so benign a cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her to behold it seemed faerie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Queen Esther never look’d with such an eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Assuere, so meek a look had she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may you not devise all her beauty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thus much of her beauty tell I may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she was hike the bright morrow of May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full filled of all beauty and pleasance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This January is ravish’d in a trance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every time he looked in her face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in his heart he gan her to menace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he that night in armes would her strain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Harder than ever Paris did Helene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless yet had he great pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thilke night offende her must he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “Alas, O tender creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now woulde God ye mighte well endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my courage, it is so sharp and keen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am aghast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> ye shall it not sustene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But God forbid that I did all my might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now woulde God that it were waxen night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the night would lasten evermo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would that all this people were y-go.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finally he did all his labour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he best mighte, saving his honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To haste them from the meat in subtle wise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The time came that reason was to rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that men dance, and drinke fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spices all about the house they cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And full of joy and bliss is every man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All but a squire, that highte Damian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who carv’d before the knight full many a day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was so ravish’d on his lady May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for the very pain he was nigh wood;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almost he swelt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> and swooned where he stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sore had Venus hurt him with her brand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As that she bare it dancing in her hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his bed he went him hastily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more of him as at this time speak I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there I let him weep enough and plain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till freshe May will rue upon his pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O perilous fire, that in the bedstraw breedeth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O foe familiar,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> that his service bedeth!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O servant traitor, O false homely hewe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to the adder in bosom shy untrue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God shield us alle from your acquaintance!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O January, drunken in pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of marriage, see how thy Damian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine owen squier and thy boren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Intendeth for to do thee villainy:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>God grante thee thine homely foe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> t’ espy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in this world is no worse pestilence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than homely foe, all day in thy presence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Performed hath the sun his arc diurn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer may the body of him sojourn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the horizon, in that latitude:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Night with his mantle, that is dark and rude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan overspread the hemisphere about:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which departed is this lusty rout<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>From January, with thank on every side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home to their houses lustily they ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as they do their thinges as them lest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they see their time they go to rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon after that this hasty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> January</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will go to bed, he will no longer tarry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He dranke hippocras, clarre,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and vernage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of spices hot, to increase his courage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a lectuary had he full fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as the cursed monk Dan Constantine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath written in his book <i>de Coitu</i>;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To eat them all he would nothing eschew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his privy friendes thus said he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For Godde’s love, as soon as it may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let voiden all this house in courteous wise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they have done right as he will devise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men drinken, and the travers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> draw anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bride is brought to bed as still as stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the bed was with the priest y-bless’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the chamber every wight him dress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And January hath fast in arms y-take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His freshe May, his paradise, his make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lulled her, he kissed her full oft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thicke bristles of his beard unsoft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to the skin of houndfish,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> sharp as brere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For he was shav’n all new in his mannere),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He rubbed her upon her tender face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide thus; “Alas! I must trespace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To you, my spouse, and you greatly offend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere time come that I will down descend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless consider this,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“There is no workman, whatsoe’er he be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may both worke well and hastily:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This will be done at leisure perfectly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no force<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> how longe that we play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In true wedlock coupled be we tway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And blessed be the yoke that we be in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in our actes may there be no sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man may do no sinne with his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor hurt himselfe with his owen knife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For we have leave to play us by the law.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus labour’d he, till that the day gan daw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then he took a sop in fine clarre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And upright in his bedde then sat he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that he sang full loud and clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And kiss’d his wife, and made wanton cheer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was all coltish, full of ragerie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And full of jargon as a flecked pie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slacke skin about his necke shaked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that he sang, so chanted he and craked.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But God wot what that May thought in her heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she him saw up sitting in his shirt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his night-cap, and with his necke lean:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She praised not his playing worth a bean.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he thus; “My reste will I take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now day is come, I may no longer wake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down he laid his head and slept till prime.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward, when that he saw his time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up rose January, but freshe May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helde her chamber till the fourthe day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As usage is of wives for the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every labour some time must have rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles longe may he not endure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, no life of creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now will I speak of woeful Damian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That languisheth for love, as ye shall hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I speak to him in this manneare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say. “O silly Damian, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer to this demand, as in this case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How shalt thou to thy lady, freshe May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Telle thy woe? She will alway say nay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eke if thou speak, she will thy woe bewray;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>God be thine help, I can no better say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sicke Damian in Venus’ fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So burned that he died for desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he put his life in aventure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer might he in this wise endure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But privily a penner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> gan he borrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In manner of a complaint or a lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his faire freshe lady May.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in a purse of silk, hung on his shirt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath it put, and laid it at his heart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The moone, that at noon was thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That January had wedded freshe May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In ten of Taure, was into Cancer glided;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long had Maius in her chamber abided,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As custom is unto these nobles all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bride shall not eaten in the ball</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till dayes four, or three days at the least,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-passed be; then let her go to feast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fourthe day complete from noon to noon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the highe masse was y-done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In halle sat this January, and May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fresh as is the brighte summer’s day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, how that this goode man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remember’d him upon this Damian.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; “Saint Mary, how may this be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Damian attendeth not to me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is he aye sick? or how may this betide?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His squiers, which that stoode there beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Excused him, because of his sickness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which letted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> him to do his business:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None other cause mighte make him tarry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That me forthinketh,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> quoth this January</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He is a gentle squier, by my truth; uneasiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that he died, it were great harm and ruth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is as wise, as discreet, and secre’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any man I know of his degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereto manly and eke serviceble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to be a thrifty man right able.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But after meat, as soon as ever I may</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will myself visit him, and eke May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do him all the comfort that I can.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for that word him blessed every man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his bounty and his gentleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He woulde so comforten in sickness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His squier, for it was a gentle deed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Dame,” quoth this January, “take good heed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At after meat, ye with your women all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(When that ye be in chamb’r out of this hall),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all ye go to see this Damian:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do him disport, he is a gentle man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And telle him that I will him visite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have I nothing but rested me a lite:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speed you faste, for I will abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that ye sleepe faste by my side.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he gan unto him call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A squier, that was marshal of his hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him certain thinges that he wo’ld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This freshe May hath straight her way y-hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all her women, unto Damian.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down by his beddes side sat she than,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comforting him as goodly as she may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Damian, when that his time he say,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In secret wise his purse, and eke his bill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which that he y-written had his will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath put into her hand withoute more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that he sighed wondrous deep and sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And softely to her right thus said he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mercy, and that ye not discover me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am dead if that this thing be kid.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The purse hath she in her bosom hid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went her way; ye get no more of me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But unto January come is she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on his bedde’s side sat full soft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took her, and he kissed her full oft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid him down to sleep, and that anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She feigned her as that she muste gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as ye know that every wight must need;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when she of this bill had taken heed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She rent it all to cloutes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> at the last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the privy softely it cast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who studieth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> now but faire freshe May?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown by olde January she lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That slepte, till the cough had him awaked:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon he pray’d her strippe her all naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would of her, he said, have some pleasance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said her clothes did him incumbrance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she obey’d him, be her lefe or loth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, lest that precious<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> folk be with me wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that he wrought I dare not to you tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or whether she thought it paradise or hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there I let them worken in their wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till evensong ring, and they must arise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Were it by destiny, or aventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were it by influence, or by nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or constellation, that in such estate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heaven stood at that time fortunate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to put a bill of Venus’ works</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For alle thing hath time, as say these clerks),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To any woman for to get her love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot say; but greate God above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That knoweth that none act is causeless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He deem<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> of all, for I will hold my peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth is this, how that this freshe May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath taken such impression that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of pity on this sicke Damian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from her hearte she not drive can</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The remembrance for to do him ease.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Certain,” thought she, “whom that this thing displease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I recke not, for here I him assure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To love him best of any creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he no more haddee than his shirt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, pity runneth soon in gentle heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here may ye see, how excellent franchise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In women is when they them narrow advise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some tyrant is⁠—as there be many a one⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath a heart as hard as any stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which would have let him sterven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> in the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well rather than have granted him her grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then rejoicen in her cruel pride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And reckon not to be a homicide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This gentle May, full filled of pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right of her hand a letter maked she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which she granted him her very grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There lacked nought, but only day and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where that she might unto his lust suffice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it shall be right as he will devise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when she saw her time upon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To visit this Damian went this May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And subtilly this letter down she thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his pillow, read it if him lust.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She took him by the hand, and hard him twist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So secretly, that no wight of it wist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade him be all whole; and forth she went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To January, when he for her sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up rose Damian the nexte morrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He combed him, he proined<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> him and picked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He did all that unto his lady liked;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke to January he went as low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ever did a dogge for the bow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is so pleasant unto every man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For craft is all, whoso that do it can),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every wight is fain to speak him good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fully in his lady’s grace he stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus leave I Damian about his need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in my tale forth I will proceed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some clerke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> holde that felicity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stands in delight; and therefore certain he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble January, with all his might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In honest wise as longeth to a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> him to live full deliciously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His housing, his array, as honestly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his degree was maked as a king’s.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amonges other of his honest things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had a garden walled all with stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fair a garden wot I nowhere none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For out of doubt I verily suppose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he that wrote the Romance of the Rose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could not of it the beauty well devise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Priapus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> mighte not well suffice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he be god of gardens, for to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beauty of the garden, and the well<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That stood under a laurel always green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full often time he, Pluto, and his queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proserpina, and all their faerie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disported them and made melody</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About that well, and danced, as men told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble knight, this January old</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such dainty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> had in it to walk and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he would suffer no wight to bear the key,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save he himself, for of the small wicket</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bare always of silver a cliket,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which, when that him list, he it unshet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he would pay his wife’s debt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In summer season, thither would he go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And May his wife, and no wight but they two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thinges which that were not done in bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He in the garden them perform’d and sped.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in this wise many a merry day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lived this January and fresh May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But worldly joy may not always endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To January, nor to no creatucere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O sudden hap! O thou fortune unstable!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to the scorpion so deceivable,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fhatt’rest with thy head when thou wilt sting;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy tail is death, through thine envenoming.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O brittle joy! O sweete poison quaint!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O monster, that so subtilly canst paint</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy giftes, under hue of steadfastness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou deceivest bothe more and less!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why hast thou January thus deceiv’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That haddest him for thy full friend receiv’d?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now thou hast bereft him both his eyen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sorrow of which desireth he to dien.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! this noble January free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid his lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> and his prosperity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is waxen blind, and that all suddenly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He weeped and he wailed piteously;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal the fire of jealousy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Lest that his wife should fall in some folly)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So burnt his hearte, that he woulde fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That some man bothe him and her had slain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For neither after his death, nor in his life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne would he that she were no love nor wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ever live as widow in clothes black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sole as the turtle that hath lost her make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last, after a month or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sorrow gan assuage, soothe to say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, when he wist it might none other be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He patiently took his adversity:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save out of doubte he may not foregon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was jealous evermore-in-one:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which jealousy was so outrageous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That neither in hall, nor in none other house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor in none other place never the mo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He woulde suffer her to ride or go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> that he had hand on her alway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which full often wepte freshe May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loved Damian so burningly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she must either dien suddenly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles she must have him as her lest:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She waited<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> when her hearte woulde brest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon that other side Damian</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Becomen is the sorrowfullest man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever was; for neither night nor day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mighte speak a word to freshe May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to his purpose, of no such mattere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> that January must it hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had a hand upon her evermo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, by writing to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privy signes, wist he what she meant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she knew eke the fine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> of his intent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O January, what might it thee avail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though thou might see as far as shippes sail?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as good is it blind deceiv’d to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be deceived when a man may see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Argus, which that had a hundred eyen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all that ever he could pore or pryen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet was he blent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> and, God wot, so be mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That weene wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> that it be not so:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pass over is an ease, I say no more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This freshe May, of which I spake yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In warm wax hath imprinted the cliket<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That January bare of the small wicket</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which into his garden oft he went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Damian, that knew all her intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cliket counterfeited privily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no more to say, but hastily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some wonder by this cliket shall betide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which ye shall hearen, if ye will abide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O noble Ovid, sooth say’st thou, God wot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What sleight is it, if love be long and hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he’ll not find it out in some mannere?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Pyramus and Thisbe may men lear;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though they were kept full long and strait o’er all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be accorded,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> rowning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> through a wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where no wight could have found out such a sleight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now to purpose; ere that dayes eight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were passed of the month of July, fill<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That January caught so great a will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through egging<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> of his wife, him for to play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his garden, and no wight but they tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in a morning to this May said he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rise up, my wife, my love, my lady free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The turtle’s voice is heard, mine owen sweet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The winter is gone, with all his raines weet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come forth now with thine eyen columbine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well fairer be thy breasts than any wine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The garden is enclosed all about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come forth, my white spouse; for, out of doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast me wounded in mine heart, O wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No spot in thee was e’er in all thy life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come forth, and let us taken our disport;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I choose thee for my wife and my comfort.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such olde lewed wordes used he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Damian a signe made she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he should go before with his cliket.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Damian then hath opened the wicket,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in he start, and that in such mannere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no wight might him either see or hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still he sat under a bush. Anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This January, as blind as is a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into this freshe garden is y-go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And clapped to the wicket suddenly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, wife,” quoth he, “here is but thou and I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art the creature that I beste love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, by that Lord that sits in heav’n above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> I had to dien on a knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than thee offende, deare true wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s sake, think how I thee chees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for no covetise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> doubteless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But only for the love I had to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though that I be old, and may not see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be to me true, and I will tell you why.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes three thinges shall ye win thereby:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First, love of Christ, and to yourself honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all mine heritage, town and tow’r.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I give it you, make charters as you lest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This shall be done to-morrow ere sun rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> God my soule bring to bliss!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you, on this covenant me kiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though that I be jealous, wite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> me not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be so deep imprinted in my thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That when that I consider your beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal th’unlikely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> eld of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not, certes, though I shoulde die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forbear to be out of your company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very love; this is withoute doubt:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This freshe May, when she these wordes heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Benignely to January answer’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first and forward she began to weep:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I have,” quoth she, “a soule for to keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well as ye, and also mine honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of my wifehood thilke tender flow’r</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that I have assured in your hond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the priest to you my body bond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I will answer in this mannere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With leave of you mine owen lord so dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God, that never dawn the day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I no sterve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> as foul as woman may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If e’er I do unto my kin that shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles I impaire so my name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I bee false; and if I do that lack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> strippe me, and put me in a sack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the nexte river do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> me drench:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a gentle woman, and no wench.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why speak ye thus? but men be e’er untrue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And women have reproof of you aye new.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye know none other dalliance, I believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But speak to us of untrust and repreve.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And with that word she saw where Damian</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat in the bush, and coughe she began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her finger signe made she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Damian should climb upon a tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That charged was with fruit; and up he went:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For verily he knew all her intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every signe that she coulde make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better than January her own make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in a letter she had told him all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this matter, how that he worke shall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus I leave him sitting in the perry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And January and May roaming full merry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Bright was the day, and blue the firmament;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phoebus of gold his streames down had sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To gladden every flow’r with his warmness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was that time in <i>Geminis</i>, I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But little from his declination</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Cancer, Jove’s exaltation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, in that bright morning-tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the garden, on the farther side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pluto, that is the king of Faerie,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Which that he ravished out of Ethna,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that she gather’d flowers in the mead</span>

					<br/>
					<span>This king of Faerie adown him set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a bank of turfes fresh and green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon thus said he to his queen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My wife,” quoth he, “there may no wight say nay⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Experience so proves it every day⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The treason which that woman doth to man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ten hundred thousand stories tell I can</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Notable of your untruth and brittleness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Solomon, richest of all richess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fill’d of sapience and worldly glory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full worthy be thy wordes of memory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every wight that wit and reason can.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus praised he yet the bounte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> of man:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Among a thousand men yet found I one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of all women found I never none.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus said this king, that knew your wickedness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Jesus, <i>Filius</i> Sirach,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> as I guess,</span>

					<span>He spake of you but seldom reverence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wilde fire and corrupt pestilence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fall upon your bodies yet to-night!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne see ye not this honourable knight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because, alas! that he is blind and old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His owen man shall make him cuckold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, where he sits, the lechour, in the tree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I granten, of my majesty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto this olde blinde worthy knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he shall have again his eyen sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that his wife will do him villainy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shall be knowen all her harlotry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both in reproof of her and other mo’.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, Sir,” quoth Proserpine,” and will ye so?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now by my mother Ceres’ soul I swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I shall give her suffisant answer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And alle women after, for her sake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That though they be in any guilt y-take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With face bold they shall themselves excuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bear them down that woulde them accuse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For lack of answer, none of them shall dien.</span>

				<p>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> had ye seen a thing with both your eyen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet shall we visage it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> so hardily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weep, and swear, and chide subtilly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye shall be as lewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> as be geese.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What recketh me of your authorities?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well that this Jew, this Solomon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Found of us women fooles many one:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But though that he founde no good woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet there hath found many another man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Women full good, and true, and virtuous;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witness on them that dwelt in Christes house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With martyrdom they proved their constance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Roman gestes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> make remembrance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of many a very true wife also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sire, be not wroth, albeit so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he said he found no good woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you take the sentence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> of the man:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He meant thus, that in sovereign bounte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is none but God, no, neither he nor she.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hey, for the very God that is but one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why make ye so much of Solomon?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What though he made a temple, Godde’s house?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What though he were rich and glorious?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So made he eke a temple of false goddes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How might he do a thing that more forbode<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> is?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pardie, as fair as ye his name emplaster,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was a lechour, and an idolaster,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his eld he very<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> God forsook.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that God had not (as saith the book)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spared him for his father’s sake, he should</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have lost his regne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> rather<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> than he would.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I sette not of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> all the villainy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he of women wrote, a butterfly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a woman, needes must I speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles swell until mine hearte break.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For since he said that we be jangleresses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ever may I brooke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> whole my tresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall not spare for no courtesy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak him harm, that said us villainy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dame,” quoth this Pluto, “be no longer wroth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I give it up: but, since I swore mine oath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I would grant to him his sight again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My word shall stand, that warn I you certain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a king; it sits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> me not to lie.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And I,” quoth she, “am queen of Faerie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her answer she shall have, I undertake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us no more wordes of it make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forsooth, I will no longer you contrary.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now let us turn again to January,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the garden with his faire May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singeth well merrier than the popinjay:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“You love I best, and shall, and other none.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long about the alleys is he gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he was come to that ilke perry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as this Damian satte full merry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On high, among the freshe leaves green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This freshe May, that is so bright and sheen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan for to sigh, and said, “Alas my side!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, Sir,” quoth she, “for aught that may betide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I must have of the peares that I see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I must die, so sore longeth me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To eaten of the smalle peares green;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help, for her love that is of heaven queen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I tell you well, a woman in my plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May have to fruit so great an appetite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she may dien, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> she of it have.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “that I had here a knave<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That coulde climb; alas! alas!” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For I am blind.” “Yea, Sir, no force,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> quoth she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“But would ye vouchesafe, for Godde’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The perry in your armes for to take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For well I wot that ye mistruste me),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would I climbe well enough,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So I my foot might set upon your back.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Certes,” said he, “therein shall be no lack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might I you helpe with mine hearte’s blood.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stooped down, and on his back she stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caught her by a twist,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and up she go’th.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Ladies, I pray you that ye be not wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot glose,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> I am a rude man):</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly anon this Damian</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan pullen up the smock, and in he throng.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that Pluto saw this greate wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To January he gave again his sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made him see as well as ever he might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he thus had caught his sight again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never man of anything so fain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But on his wife his thought was evermo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to the tree he cast his eyen two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw how Damian his wife had dress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such mannere, it may not be express’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> I woulde speak uncourteously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up he gave a roaring and a cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth the mother when the child shall die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Out! help! alas! harow!” he gan to cry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O stronge, lady, stowre!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> what doest thou?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And she answered: “Sir, what aileth you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have patience and reason in your mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have you help’d on both your eyen blind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On peril of my soul, I shall not lien,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As me was taught to helpe with your eyen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was nothing better for to make you see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than struggle with a man upon a tree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God wot, I did it in full good intent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Struggle!” quoth he, “yea, algate in it went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God give you both one shame’s death to dien!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He swived thee; I saw it with mine eyen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And elles be I hanged by the halse.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Then is,” quoth she, “my medicine all false;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certainly, if that ye mighte see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye would not say these wordes unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have some glimpsing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> and no perfect sight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I see,” quoth he, “as well as ever I might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Thanked be God!) with both mine eyen two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by my faith me thought he did thee so.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye maze, ye maze,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> goode Sir,” quoth she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This thank have I for I have made you see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas!” quoth she, “that e’er I was so kind.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Dame,” quoth he, “let all pass out of mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come down, my lefe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and if I have missaid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God help me so, as I am evil apaid.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, by my father’s soul, I ween’d have seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that this Damian had by thee lain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thy smock had lain upon his breast.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yea, Sir,” quoth she, “ye may ween as ye lest:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sir, a man that wakes out of his sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He may not suddenly well take keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a thing, nor see it perfectly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that he be adawed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> verily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so a man, that long hath blind y-be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He may not suddenly so well y-see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First when his sight is newe come again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he that hath a day or two y-seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that your sight establish’d be a while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There may full many a sighte you beguile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware, I pray you, for, by heaven’s king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a man weeneth to see a thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it is all another than it seemeth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He which that misconceiveth oft misdeemeth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word she leapt down from the tree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This January, who is glad but he?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He kissed her, and clipped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> her full oft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on her womb he stroked her full soft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his palace home he hath her lad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goode men, I pray you to be glad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus endeth here my tale of January,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God bless us, and his mother, Sainte Mary.</span>
