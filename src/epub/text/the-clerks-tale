		<p>
		<span>"SIR Clerk of Oxenford," our Hoste said,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That were new spoused, sitting at the board:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This day I heard not of your tongue a word.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I trow ye study about some sophime:* *sophism</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But Solomon saith, every thing hath time.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For Godde's sake, be of *better cheer,* *livelier mien*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>It is no time for to study here.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Tell us some merry tale, by your fay;* *faith</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For what man that is entered in a play,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He needes must unto that play assent.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But preache not, as friars do in Lent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To make us for our olde sinnes weep,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Nor that thy tale make us not to sleep.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Tell us some merry thing of aventures.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your terms, your coloures, and your figures,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Keep them in store, till so be ye indite</span>
		<br/>
		<span>High style, as when that men to kinges write.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Speake so plain at this time, I you pray,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That we may understande what ye say."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>This worthy Clerk benignely answer'd;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Hoste," quoth he, "I am under your yerd,* *rod &lt;1&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ye have of us as now the governance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And therefore would I do you obeisance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As far as reason asketh, hardily:* *boldly, truly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I will you tell a tale, which that I</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Learn'd at Padova of a worthy clerk,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As proved by his wordes and his werk.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He is now dead, and nailed in his chest,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I pray to God to give his soul good rest.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Francis Petrarc', the laureate poet,&lt;2&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Highte* this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet *was called</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Illumin'd all Itale of poetry,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As Linian &lt;3&gt; did of philosophy,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Or law, or other art particulere:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But death, that will not suffer us dwell here</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But as it were a twinkling of an eye,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Them both hath slain, and alle we shall die.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"But forth to tellen of this worthy man,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That taughte me this tale, as I began,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I say that first he with high style inditeth</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(Ere he the body of his tale writeth)</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A proem, in the which describeth he</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Piedmont, and of Saluces &lt;4&gt; the country,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And speaketh of the Pennine hilles high,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That be the bounds of all West Lombardy:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of Mount Vesulus in special,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where as the Po out of a welle small</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Taketh his firste springing and his source,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That eastward aye increaseth in his course</span>
		<br/>
		<span>T'Emilia-ward, &lt;5&gt; to Ferraro, and Venice,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The which a long thing were to devise.* *narrate</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And truely, as to my judgement,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,* *irrelevant</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Save that he would conveye his mattere:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But this is the tale, which that ye shall hear."</span>

		<p>
		<span>There is, right at the west side of Itale,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Down at the root of Vesulus&lt;2&gt; the cold,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A lusty* plain, abundant of vitaille;* *pleasant **victuals</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There many a town and tow'r thou may'st behold,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That founded were in time of fathers old,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And many another delectable sight;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And Saluces this noble country hight.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>A marquis whilom lord was of that land,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As were his worthy elders* him before, *ancestors</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And obedient, aye ready to his hand,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Were all his lieges, bothe less and more:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thus in delight he liv'd, and had done yore,* *long</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Belov'd and drad,* through favour of fortune, *held in reverence</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Both of his lordes and of his commune.* *commonalty</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Therewith he was, to speak of lineage,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The gentilest y-born of Lombardy,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A fair person, and strong, and young of age,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And full of honour and of courtesy:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Discreet enough his country for to gie,* *guide, rule</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Saving in some things that he was to blame;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And Walter was this younge lordes name.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>I blame him thus, that he consider'd not</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In time coming what might him betide,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But on his present lust* was all his thought, *pleasure</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And for to hawk and hunt on every side;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Well nigh all other cares let he slide,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke he would (that was the worst of all)</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wedde no wife for aught that might befall.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Only that point his people bare so sore,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That flockmel* on a day to him they went, *in a body</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And one of them, that wisest was of lore</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(Or elles that the lord would best assent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he should tell him what the people meant,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Or elles could he well shew such mattere),</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He to the marquis said as ye shall hear.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"O noble Marquis! your humanity</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Assureth us and gives us hardiness,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As oft as time is of necessity,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That we to you may tell our heaviness:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Accepte, Lord, now of your gentleness,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What we with piteous heart unto you plain,* *complain of</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And let your ears my voice not disdain.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"All* have I nought to do in this mattere *although</span>
		<br/>
		<span>More than another man hath in this place,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Yet forasmuch as ye, my Lord so dear,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Have always shewed me favour and grace,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I dare the better ask of you a space</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of audience, to shewen our request,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And ye, my Lord, to do right *as you lest.* *as pleaseth you*</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"For certes, Lord, so well us like you</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And all your work, and ev'r have done, that we</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ne coulde not ourselves devise how</span>
		<br/>
		<span>We mighte live in more felicity:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Save one thing, Lord, if that your will it be,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That for to be a wedded man you lest;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Then were your people *in sovereign hearte's rest.* *completely</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Bowe your neck under the blissful yoke</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of sovereignty, and not of service,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Which that men call espousal or wedlock:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And thinke, Lord, among your thoughtes wise,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>How that our dayes pass in sundry wise;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For though we sleep, or wake, or roam, or ride,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Aye fleeth time, it will no man abide.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"And though your greene youthe flow'r as yet,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In creepeth age always as still as stone,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And death menaceth every age, and smit* *smiteth</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In each estate, for there escapeth none:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And all so certain as we know each one</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That we shall die, as uncertain we all</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Be of that day when death shall on us fall.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Accepte then of us the true intent,* *mind, desire</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That never yet refused youre hest,* *command</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And we will, Lord, if that ye will assent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Choose you a wife, in short time at the lest,* *least</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Born of the gentilest and of the best</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of all this land, so that it ought to seem</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Honour to God and you, as we can deem.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Deliver us out of all this busy dread,* *doubt</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And take a wife, for highe Godde's sake:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For if it so befell, as God forbid,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That through your death your lineage should slake,* *become extinct</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And that a strange successor shoulde take</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your heritage, oh! woe were us on live:* *alive</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wherefore we pray you hastily to wive."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Their meeke prayer and their piteous cheer</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Made the marquis for to have pity.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Ye will," quoth he, "mine owen people dear,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To that I ne'er ere* thought constraine me. *before</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I me rejoiced of my liberty,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That seldom time is found in rnarriage;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where I was free, I must be in servage!* *servitude</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"But natheless I see your true intent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And trust upon your wit, and have done aye:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wherefore of my free will I will assent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To wedde me, as soon as e'er I may.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But whereas ye have proffer'd me to-day</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To choose me a wife, I you release</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That choice, and pray you of that proffer cease.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"For God it wot, that children often been</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unlike their worthy elders them before,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Bounte* comes all of God, not of the strene** *goodness</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of which they be engender'd and y-bore: **stock, race</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I trust in Godde's bounte, and therefore</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My marriage, and mine estate and rest,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I *him betake;* he may do as him lest. *commend to him</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Let me alone in choosing of my wife;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That charge upon my back I will endure:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But I you pray, and charge upon your life,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That what wife that I take, ye me assure</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To worship* her, while that her life may dure, *honour</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In word and work both here and elleswhere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As she an emperore's daughter were.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"And farthermore this shall ye swear, that ye</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Against my choice shall never grudge* nor strive. *murmur</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For since I shall forego my liberty</span>
		<br/>
		<span>At your request, as ever may I thrive,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where as mine heart is set, there will I live</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And but* ye will assent in such mannere, *unless</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I pray you speak no more of this mattere."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>With heartly will they sworen and assent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To all this thing, there said not one wight nay:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Beseeching him of grace, ere that they went,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he would grante them a certain day</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of his espousal, soon as e'er he rnay,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For yet always the people somewhat dread* *were in fear or doubt</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lest that the marquis woulde no wife wed.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>He granted them a day, such as him lest,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>On which he would be wedded sickerly,* *certainly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And said he did all this at their request;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And they with humble heart full buxomly,* *obediently &lt;3&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Him thanked all; and thus they have an end</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of their intent, and home again they wend.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And hereupon he to his officers</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Commanded for the feaste to purvey.* *provide</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to his privy knightes and squiers</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Such charge he gave, as him list on them lay:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And they to his commandement obey,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And each of them doth all his diligence</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To do unto the feast all reverence.</span>

		<p>
		<span>Not far from thilke* palace honourable, *that</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where as this marquis shope* his marriage, *prepared; resolved on</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There stood a thorp,* of sighte delectable, *hamlet</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In which the poore folk of that village</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Hadde their beastes and their harbourage,* *dwelling</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of their labour took their sustenance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>After the earthe gave them abundance.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Among this poore folk there dwelt a man</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Which that was holden poorest of them all;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But highe God sometimes sende can</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His grace unto a little ox's stall;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Janicola men of that thorp him call.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A daughter had he, fair enough to sight,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And Griseldis this younge maiden hight.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>But for to speak of virtuous beauty,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Then was she one the fairest under sun:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Full poorely y-foster'd up was she;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>No *likerous lust* was in her heart y-run; *luxurious pleasure*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Well ofter of the well than of the tun</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She drank, &lt;4&gt; and, for* she woulde virtue please *because</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She knew well labour, but no idle ease.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>But though this maiden tender were of age;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Yet in the breast of her virginity</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There was inclos'd a *sad and ripe corage;* *steadfast and mature</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And in great reverence and charity spirit*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Her olde poore father foster'd she.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A few sheep, spinning, on the field she kept,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She woulde not be idle till she slept.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And when she homeward came, she would bring</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wortes,* and other herbes, times oft, *plants, cabbages</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The which she shred and seeth'd for her living,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And made her bed full hard, and nothing soft:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And aye she kept her father's life on loft* *up, aloft</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With ev'ry obeisance and diligence,</span>

		<p>
		<span>Upon Griselda, this poor creature,</span>

		<span>Full often sithes* this marquis set his eye, *times</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As he on hunting rode, paraventure:* *by chance</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And when it fell that he might her espy,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He not with wanton looking of folly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His eyen cast on her, but in sad* wise *serious</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon her cheer* he would him oft advise;** *countenance **consider</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Commending in his heart her womanhead,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke her virtue, passing any wight</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of so young age, as well in cheer as deed.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For though the people have no great insight</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In virtue, he considered full right</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Her bounte,* and disposed that he would *goodness</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wed only her, if ever wed he should.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The day of wedding came, but no wight can</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Telle what woman that it shoulde be;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For which marvail wonder'd many a man,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And saide, when they were in privity,</span>

		<br/>
		<span>Why will he thus himself and us beguile?"</span>

		<span>Of gemmes, set in gold and in azure,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Brooches and ringes, for Griselda's sake,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of her clothing took he the measure</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of a maiden like unto her stature,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke of other ornamentes all</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That unto such a wedding shoulde fall.* *befit</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The time of undern* of the same day *evening &lt;5&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Approached, that this wedding shoulde be,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And all the palace put was in array,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Both hall and chamber, each in its degree,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Houses of office stuffed with plenty</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There may'st thou see of dainteous vitaille,* *victuals, provisions</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That may be found, as far as lasts Itale.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>This royal marquis, richely array'd,</span>

		<span>The which unto the feaste were pray'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of his retinue the bach'lery,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With many a sound of sundry melody,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unto the village, of the which I told,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In this array the right way did they hold.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Griseld' of this (God wot) full innocent,</span>

		<span>For well she had heard say, that on that day</span>

		<span>She thought, "I will with other maidens stand,</span>

		<span>To do at home, as soon as it may be,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The labour which belongeth unto me,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And then I may at leisure her behold,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>If she this way unto the castle hold."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And as she would over the threshold gon,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The marquis came and gan for her to call,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And she set down her water-pot anon</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Beside the threshold, in an ox's stall,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And down upon her knees she gan to fall,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And with sad* countenance kneeled still, *steady</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Till she had heard what was the lorde's will.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The thoughtful marquis spake unto the maid</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Full soberly, and said in this mannere:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Where is your father, Griseldis?" he said.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And she with reverence, *in humble cheer,* *with humble air*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Answered, "Lord, he is all ready here."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And in she went withoute longer let* *delay</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to the marquis she her father fet.* *fetched</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>He by the hand then took the poore man,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And saide thus, when he him had aside:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Janicola, I neither may nor can</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Longer the pleasance of mine hearte hide;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>If that thou vouchesafe, whatso betide,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thy daughter will I take, ere that I wend,* *go</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As for my wife, unto her life's end.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Thou lovest me, that know I well certain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And art my faithful liegeman y-bore,* *born</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And all that liketh me, I dare well sayn</span>
		<br/>
		<span>It liketh thee; and specially therefore</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Tell me that point, that I have said before, —</span>
		<br/>
		<span>If that thou wilt unto this purpose draw,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To take me as for thy son-in-law."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>This sudden case* the man astonied so, *event</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That red he wax'd, abash'd,* and all quaking *amazed</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He stood; unnethes* said he wordes mo', *scarcely</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But only thus; "Lord," quoth he, "my willing</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Is as ye will, nor against your liking</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I will no thing, mine owen lord so dear;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Right as you list governe this mattere."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Then will I," quoth the marquis softely,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"That in thy chamber I, and thou, and she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Have a collation;* and know'st thou why? *conference</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For I will ask her, if her will it be</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To be my wife, and rule her after me:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And all this shall be done in thy presence,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I will not speak out of thine audience."* *hearing</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And in the chamber while they were about</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The treaty, which ye shall hereafter hear,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The people came into the house without,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And wonder'd them in how honest mannere</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And tenderly she kept her father dear;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But utterly Griseldis wonder might,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For never erst* ne saw she such a sight. *before</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>No wonder is though that she be astoned,* *astonished</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To see so great a guest come in that place,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She never was to no such guestes woned;* *accustomed, wont</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For which she looked with full pale face.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But shortly forth this matter for to chase,* *push on, pursue</span>
		<br/>
		<span>These are the wordes that the marquis said</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To this benigne, very,* faithful maid. *true &lt;6&gt;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Griseld'," he said, "ye shall well understand,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>It liketh to your father and to me</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That I you wed, and eke it may so stand,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As I suppose ye will that it so be:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But these demandes ask I first," quoth he,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Since that it shall be done in hasty wise;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Will ye assent, or elles you advise?* *consider</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"I say this, be ye ready with good heart</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To all my lust,* and that I freely may, *pleasure</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As me best thinketh, *do you* laugh or smart, *cause you to*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And never ye to grudge,* night nor day, *murmur</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke when I say Yea, ye say not Nay,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Neither by word, nor frowning countenance?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Swear this, and here I swear our alliance."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Wond'ring upon this word, quaking for dread,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She saide; "Lord, indigne and unworthy</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Am I to this honour that ye me bede,* *offer</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But as ye will yourself, right so will I:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And here I swear, that never willingly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In word or thought I will you disobey,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For to be dead; though me were loth to dey."* *die</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"This is enough, Griselda mine," quoth he.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And forth he went with a full sober cheer,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Out at the door, and after then came she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to the people he said in this mannere:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"This is my wife," quoth he, "that standeth here.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Honoure her, and love her, I you pray,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Whoso me loves; there is no more to say."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And, for that nothing of her olde gear</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She shoulde bring into his house, he bade</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That women should despoile* her right there; *strip</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of which these ladies were nothing glad</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To handle her clothes wherein she was clad:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless this maiden bright of hue</span>
		<br/>
		<span>From foot to head they clothed have all new.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Her haires have they comb'd that lay untress'd* *loose</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Full rudely, and with their fingers small</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A crown upon her head they have dress'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And set her full of nouches &lt;7&gt; great and small:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of her array why should I make a tale?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unneth* the people her knew for her fairness, *scarcely</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When she transmuted was in such richess.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The marquis hath her spoused with a ring</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Brought for the same cause, and then her set</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon a horse snow-white, and well ambling,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to his palace, ere he longer let* *delayed</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With joyful people, that her led and met,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Conveyed her; and thus the day they spend</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In revel, till the sunne gan descend.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And, shortly forth this tale for to chase,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I say, that to this newe marchioness</span>
		<br/>
		<span>God hath such favour sent her of his grace,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That it ne seemed not by likeliness</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That she was born and fed in rudeness, —</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As in a cot, or in an ox's stall, —</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But nourish'd in an emperore's hall.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>To every wight she waxen* is so dear *grown</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And worshipful, that folk where she was born,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That from her birthe knew her year by year,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*Unnethes trowed* they, but durst have sworn, *scarcely believed*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That to Janicol' of whom I spake before,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She was not daughter, for by conjecture</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Them thought she was another creature.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>For though that ever virtuous was she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She was increased in such excellence</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of thewes* good, y-set in high bounte, *qualities</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And so discreet, and fair of eloquence,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So benign, and so digne* of reverence, *worthy</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And coulde so the people's heart embrace,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That each her lov'd that looked on her face.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Not only of Saluces in the town</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Published was the bounte of her name,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But eke besides in many a regioun;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>If one said well, another said the same:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So spread of here high bounte the fame,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That men and women, young as well as old,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Went to Saluces, her for to behold.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Thus Walter lowly, — nay, but royally,-</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wedded with fortn'ate honestete,* *virtue</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In Godde's peace lived full easily</span>
		<br/>
		<span>At home, and outward grace enough had he:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And, for he saw that under low degree</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Was honest virtue hid, the people him held</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A prudent man, and that is seen full seld'.* *seldom</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Not only this Griseldis through her wit</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*Couth all the feat* of wifely homeliness, *knew all the duties*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But eke, when that the case required it,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The common profit coulde she redress:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There n'as discord, rancour, nor heaviness</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In all the land, that she could not appease,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And wisely bring them all in rest and ease</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Though that her husband absent were or non,* *not</span>
		<br/>
		<span>If gentlemen or other of that country,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Were wroth,* she woulde bringe them at one, *at feud</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So wise and ripe wordes hadde she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And judgement of so great equity,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That she from heaven sent was, as men wend,* *weened, imagined</span>
		<br/>
		<span>People to save, and every wrong t'amend</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Not longe time after that this Griseld'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Was wedded, she a daughter had y-bore;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>All she had lever* borne a knave** child, *rather **boy</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Glad was the marquis and his folk therefore;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For, though a maiden child came all before,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She may unto a knave child attain</span>
		<br/>
		<span>By likelihood, since she is not barren.</span>

		<span>There fell, as falleth many times mo',</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When that his child had sucked but a throw,* little while</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This marquis in his hearte longed so</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To tempt his wife, her sadness* for to know, *steadfastness</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he might not out of his hearte throw</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This marvellous desire his wife t'asssay;* *try</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Needless,* God wot, he thought her to affray.** *without cause</span>
		<br/>
		<span>                                                        **alarm, disturb</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He had assayed her anough before,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And found her ever good; what needed it</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Her for to tempt, and always more and more?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Though some men praise it for a subtle wit,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But as for me, I say that *evil it sit* *it ill became him*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>T'assay a wife when that it is no need,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And putte her in anguish and in dread.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>For which this marquis wrought in this mannere:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He came at night alone there as she lay,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With sterne face and with full troubled cheer,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And saide thus; "Griseld'," quoth he "that day</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That I you took out of your poor array,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And put you in estate of high nobless,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ye have it not forgotten, as I guess.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"I say, Griseld', this present dignity,</span>

		<span>In which that I have put you, as I trow* *believe</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Maketh you not forgetful for to be</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That I you took in poor estate full low,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For any weal you must yourselfe know.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Take heed of every word that I you say,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There is no wight that hears it but we tway.* *two</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Ye know yourself well how that ye came here</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Into this house, it is not long ago;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And though to me ye be right lefe* and dear, *loved</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unto my gentles* ye be nothing so: *nobles, gentlefolk</span>
		<br/>
		<span>They say, to them it is great shame and woe</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For to be subject, and be in servage,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To thee, that born art of small lineage.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"And namely* since thy daughter was y-bore *especially</span>
		<br/>
		<span>These wordes have they spoken doubteless;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But I desire, as I have done before,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To live my life with them in rest and peace:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I may not in this case be reckeless;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I must do with thy daughter for the best,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Not as I would, but as my gentles lest.* *please</span>

		<span>"And yet, God wot, this is full loth* to me: *odious</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless withoute your weeting* *knowing</span>

		<span>I will nought do; but this will I," quoth he,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"That ye to me assenten in this thing.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Shew now your patience in your working,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That ye me hight* and swore in your village *promised</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The day that maked was our marriage."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>When she had heard all this, she not amev'd* *changed</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Neither in word, in cheer, nor countenance</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(For, as it seemed, she was not aggriev'd);</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She saide; "Lord, all lies in your pleasance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My child and I, with hearty obeisance</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Be youres all, and ye may save or spill* *destroy</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your owen thing: work then after your will.</span>

		<p>
		<span>"There may no thing, so God my soule save,</span>

		<span>This will is in mine heart, and aye shall be,</span>

		<span>No length of time, nor death, may this deface,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Nor change my corage* to another place." *spirit, heart</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Glad was the marquis for her answering,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But yet he feigned as he were not so;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>All dreary was his cheer and his looking</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When that he should out of the chamber go.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Soon after this, a furlong way or two,&lt;8&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He privily hath told all his intent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unto a man, and to his wife him sent.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>A *manner sergeant* was this private* man, *kind of squire*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The which he faithful often founden had *discreet</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In thinges great, and eke such folk well can</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Do execution in thinges bad:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The lord knew well, that he him loved and drad.* *dreaded</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And when this sergeant knew his lorde's will,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Into the chamber stalked he full still.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Madam," he said, "ye must forgive it me,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Though I do thing to which I am constrain'd;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ye be so wise, that right well knowe ye</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*That lordes' hestes may not be y-feign'd;* *see note &lt;9&gt;*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>They may well be bewailed and complain'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But men must needs unto their lust* obey; *pleasure</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And so will I, there is no more to say.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"This child I am commanded for to take."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And spake no more, but out the child he hent* *seized</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Dispiteously,* and gan a cheer** to make *unpityingly **show, aspect</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As though he would have slain it ere he went.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Griseldis must all suffer and consent:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And as a lamb she sat there meek and still,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And let this cruel sergeant do his will</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Suspicious* was the diffame** of this man, *ominous **evil reputation</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Suspect his face, suspect his word also,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Suspect the time in which he this began:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Alas! her daughter, that she loved so,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She weened* he would have it slain right tho,** *thought **then</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless she neither wept nor siked,* *sighed</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Conforming her to what the marquis liked.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>But at the last to speake she began,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And meekly she unto the sergeant pray'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So as he was a worthy gentle man,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That she might kiss her child, ere that it died:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And in her barme* this little child she laid, *lap, bosom</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With full sad face, and gan the child to bless,* *cross</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And lulled it, and after gan it kiss.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And thus she said in her benigne voice:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Farewell, my child, I shall thee never see;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But since I have thee marked with the cross,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of that father y-blessed may'st thou be</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That for us died upon a cross of tree:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thy soul, my little child, I *him betake,* *commit unto him*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For this night shalt thou dien for my sake.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>I trow* that to a norice** in this case *believe **nurse</span>
		<br/>
		<span>It had been hard this ruthe* for to see: *pitiful sight</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Well might a mother then have cried, "Alas!"</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless so sad steadfast was she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That she endured all adversity,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to the sergeant meekely she said,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Have here again your little younge maid.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Go now," quoth she, "and do my lord's behest.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And one thing would I pray you of your grace,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*But if* my lord forbade you at the least, *unless*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Bury this little body in some place,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That neither beasts nor birdes it arace."* *tear &lt;10&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But he no word would to that purpose say,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But took the child and went upon his way.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The sergeant came unto his lord again,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of Griselda's words and of her cheer* *demeanour</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He told him point for point, in short and plain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And him presented with his daughter dear.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Somewhat this lord had ruth in his mannere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless his purpose held he still,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As lordes do, when they will have their will;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>And bade this sergeant that he privily</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Shoulde the child full softly wind and wrap,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With alle circumstances tenderly,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And carry it in a coffer, or in lap;</span>
		<br/>

		<span>That at that time of Panic'* was Countess, *Panico</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He should it take, and shew her this mattere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Beseeching her to do her business</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This child to foster in all gentleness,</span>

		<span>The sergeant went, and hath fulfill'd this thing.</span>

		<span>If by his wife's cheer he mighte see,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Or by her wordes apperceive, that she</span>
		<br/>

		<span>As glad, as humble, as busy in service,</span>

		<span>And eke in love, as she was wont to be,</span>

		<span>This marquis *caughte yet another lest* *was seized by yet</span>

		<span>But wedded men *not connen no measure,* *know no moderation*</span>

		<p>
		<span>"Now say they thus, 'When Walter is y-gone,</span>

		<span>Then shall the blood of Janicol' succeed,</span>

		<span>And be our lord, for other have we none:'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Such wordes say my people, out of drede.* *doubt</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Well ought I of such murmur take heed,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For certainly I dread all such sentence,* *expression of opinion</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Though they not *plainen in mine audience.* *complain in my hearing*</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"I woulde live in peace, if that I might;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wherefore I am disposed utterly,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As I his sister served ere* by night, *before</span>

		<span>This warn I you, that ye not suddenly</span>

		<span>Out of yourself for no woe should outraie;* *become outrageous, rave</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Be patient, and thereof I you pray."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"I have," quoth she, "said thus, and ever shall,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I will no thing, nor n'ill no thing, certain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But as you list; not grieveth me at all</span>

		<span>At your commandement; that is to sayn,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I have not had no part of children twain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But first sickness, and after woe and pain.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Ye be my lord, do with your owen thing</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Right as you list, and ask no rede of me:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For, as I left at home all my clothing</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When I came first to you, right so," quoth she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Left I my will and all my liberty,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And took your clothing: wherefore I you pray,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Do your pleasance, I will your lust* obey. *will</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"And, certes, if I hadde prescience</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your will to know, ere ye your lust* me told, *will</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I would it do withoute negligence:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But, now I know your lust, and what ye wo'ld,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>All your pleasance firm and stable I hold;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For, wist I that my death might do you ease,</span>

		<span>Right gladly would I dien you to please.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Death may not make no comparisoun</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unto your love." And when this marquis say* *saw</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The constance of his wife, he cast adown</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His eyen two, and wonder'd how she may</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In patience suffer all this array;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And forth he went with dreary countenance;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But to his heart it was full great pleasance.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>This ugly sergeant, in the same wise</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he her daughter caught, right so hath he</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(Or worse, if men can any worse devise,)</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Y-hent* her son, that full was of beauty: *seized</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And ever-in-one* so patient was she, *unvaryingly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That she no cheere made of heaviness,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But kiss'd her son, and after gan him bless.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Save this she prayed him, if that he might,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Her little son he would in earthe grave,* *bury</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His tender limbes, delicate to sight,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>From fowles and from beastes for to save.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But she none answer of him mighte have;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He went his way, as him nothing ne raught,* *cared</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But to Bologna tenderly it brought.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The marquis wonder'd ever longer more</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon her patience; and, if that he</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Not hadde soothly knowen therebefore</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That perfectly her children loved she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He would have ween'd* that of some subtilty, *thought</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of malice, or for cruel corage,* *disposition</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She hadde suffer'd this with sad* visage. *steadfast, unmoved</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>But well he knew, that, next himself, certain</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She lov'd her children best in every wise.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But now of women would I aske fain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>If these assayes mighte not suffice?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What could a sturdy* husband more devise *stern</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To prove her wifehood and her steadfastness,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And he continuing ev'r in sturdiness?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>But there be folk of such condition,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That, when they have a certain purpose take,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thiey cannot stint* of their intention, *cease</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But, right as they were bound unto a stake,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>They will not of their firste purpose slake:* *slacken, abate</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Right so this marquis fully hath purpos'd</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To tempt his wife, as he was first dispos'd.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>He waited, if by word or countenance</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That she to him was changed of corage:* *spirit</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But never could he finde variance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She was aye one in heart and in visage,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And aye the farther that she was in age,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The more true (if that it were possible)</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She was to him in love, and more penible.* *painstaking in devotion</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>For which it seemed thus, that of them two</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There was but one will; for, as Walter lest,* *pleased</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The same pleasance was her lust* also; *pleasure</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And, God be thanked, all fell for the best.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>She shewed well, for no worldly unrest,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A wife as of herself no thinge should</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Will, in effect, but as her husbaud would.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The sland'r of Walter wondrous wide sprad,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That of a cruel heart he wickedly,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For* he a poore woman wedded had, *because</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Had murder'd both his children privily:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Such murmur was among them commonly.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>No wonder is: for to the people's ear</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There came no word, but that they murder'd were.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>For which, whereas his people therebefore</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Had lov'd him well, the sland'r of his diffame* *infamy</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Made them that they him hated therefore.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To be a murd'rer is a hateful name.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless, for earnest or for game,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He of his cruel purpose would not stent;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To tempt his wife was set all his intent.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>When that his daughter twelve year was of age,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He to the Court of Rome, in subtle wise</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Informed of his will, sent his message,* *messenger</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Commanding him such bulles to devise</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As to his cruel purpose may suffice,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>How that the Pope, for his people's rest,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Bade him to wed another, if him lest.* *wished</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>I say he bade they shoulde counterfeit</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The Pope's bulles, making mention</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he had leave his firste wife to lete,* *leave</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To stinte* rancour and dissension *put an end to</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Betwixt his people and him: thus spake the bull,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The which they have published at full.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The rude people, as no wonder is,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Weened* full well that it had been right so: *thought, believed</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But, when these tidings came to Griseldis.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I deeme that her heart was full of woe;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But she, alike sad* for evermo', *steadfast</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Disposed was, this humble creature,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Th' adversity of fortune all t' endure;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>Abiding ever his lust and his pleasance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To whom that she was given, heart and all,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As *to her very worldly suffisance.* *to the utmost extent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But, shortly if this story tell I shall, of her power*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The marquis written hath in special</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A letter, in which he shewed his intent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And secretly it to Bologna sent.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>To th' earl of Panico, which hadde tho* *there</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wedded his sister, pray'd he specially</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To bringe home again his children two</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In honourable estate all openly:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But one thing he him prayed utterly,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he to no wight, though men would inquere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Shoulde not tell whose children that they were,</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>But say, the maiden should y-wedded be</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unto the marquis of Saluce anon.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And as this earl was prayed, so did he,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For, at day set, he on his way is gone</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Toward Saluce, and lorde's many a one</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In rich array, this maiden for to guide, —</span>

		<span>Her younge brother riding her beside.</span>

		<span>Her brother, which that seven year was of age,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Arrayed eke full fresh in his mannere:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And thus, in great nobless, and with glad cheer,</span>

		<span>In rest and peace, after his father's day:</span>

		<span>This world is not so strong, it *is no nay,* *not to be denied*</span>

		<span>This story is said, &lt;14&gt; not for that wives should</span>

		<br/>
		<span>With sharpe scourges of adversity</span>

		<span>Full often to be beat in sundry wise;</span>

		<span>Not for to know our will, for certes he,</span>

		<p>Notes to the Clerk's Tale</p>
		<p>1. Petrarch, in his Latin romance, "De obedientia et fide uxoria Mythologia," (Of obedient and faithful wives in Mythology) translated the charming story of "the patient Grizel" from the Italian of Bocaccio's "Decameron;" and Chaucer has closely followed Petrarch's translation, made in 1373, the year before that in which he died. The fact that the embassy to Genoa, on which Chaucer was sent, took place in 1372-73, has lent countenance to the opinion that the English poet did actually visit the Italian bard at Padua, and hear the story from his own lips. This, however, is only a probability; for it is a moot point whether the two poets ever met.</p>
		<p>2. Vesulus: Monte Viso, a lofty peak at the junction of the Maritime and Cottian Alps; from two springs on its east side rises the Po.</p>
		<p>3. Buxomly: obediently; Anglo-Saxon, "bogsom," old English, "boughsome," that can be easily bent or bowed; German, "biegsam," pliant, obedient.</p>
		<p>4. Well ofter of the well than of the tun she drank: she drank water much more often than wine.</p>
		<p>5. Undern: afternoon, evening, though by some "undern" is understood as dinner-time — 9 a. m. See note 4 to the Wife of Bath's Tale.</p>
		<p>6. Very: true; French "vrai".</p>
		<p>7. Nouches: Ornaments of some kind not precisely known; some editions read "ouches," studs, brooches. (Transcriber's note: The OED gives "nouches" as a form of "ouches," buckles)</p>
		<p>8. A furlong way or two: a short time; literally, as long as it takes to walk one or two furlongs (a furlong is 220 yards)</p>
		<p>9. Lordes' hestes may not be y-feign'd: it will not do merely to feign compliance with a lord's commands.</p>
		<p>10. Arace: tear; French, "arracher."</p>
		<p>11. Fele: many; German, "viel."</p>
		<p>12. Dear enough a jane: worth nothing. A jane was a small coin of little worth, so the meaning is "not worth a red cent".</p>
		<p>13. Mo: me. "This is one of the most licentious corruptions of orthography," says Tyrwhitt, "that I remember to have observed in Chaucer;" but such liberties were common among the European poets of his time, when there was an extreme lack of certainty in orthography.</p>
		<p>14. The fourteen lines that follow are translated almost literally from Petrarch's Latin.</p>
		<p>15. For great skill is he proved that he wrought: for it is most reasonable that He should prove or test that which he made.</p>
		<p>16. Chichevache, in old popular fable, was a monster that fed only on good women, and was always very thin from scarcity of such food; a corresponding monster, Bycorne, fed only on obedient and kind husbands, and was always fat. The origin of the fable was French; but Lydgate has a ballad on the subject. "Chichevache" literally means "niggardly" or "greedy cow."</p>
		<p>17. Countertail: Counter-tally or counter-foil; something exactly corresponding.</p>
		<p>18. Aventail: forepart of a helmet, vizor.</p>
