					<span>Listen, lordings, in good intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I will tell you <i>verament</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of mirth and of solas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All of a knight was fair and gent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In battle and in tournament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His name was Sir Thopas.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-born he was in far country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Flanders, all beyond the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At Popering<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> in the place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His father was a man full free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lord he was of that country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it was Godde's grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Thopas was a doughty swain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>White was his face as paindemain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His lippes red as rose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His rode<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> is like scarlet in grain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I you tell in good certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had a seemly nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hair, his beard, was like saffroun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to his girdle reach'd adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His shoes of cordewane:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Bruges were his hosen brown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His robe was of ciclatoun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That coste many a jane.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coulde hunt at the wild deer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ride on hawking for rivere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With gray goshawk on hand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto he was a good archere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wrestling was there none his peer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where any ram<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> should stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a maiden bright in bow'r</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They mourned for him <i>par amour</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When them were better sleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was chaste, and no lechour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweet as is the bramble flow'r</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That beareth the red heep.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so it fell upon a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sooth as I you telle may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Thopas would out ride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He worth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> upon his steede gray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his hand a launcegay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A long sword by his side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He pricked through a fair forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein is many a wilde beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yea, bothe buck and hare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he pricked north and east,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I tell it you, him had almest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Betid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> a sorry care.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The liquorice and the setewall,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many a clove-gilofre,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nutemeg to put in ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether it be moist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> or stale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or for to lay in coffer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The birdes sang, it is no nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sperhawk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and the popinjay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That joy it was to hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The throstle-cock made eke his lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woode-dove upon the spray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She sang full loud and clear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Thopas fell in love-longing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All when he heard the throstle sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prick'd as he were wood;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His faire steed in his pricking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweated, that men might him wring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His sides were all blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Thopas eke so weary was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For pricking on the softe grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fierce was his corage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That down he laid him in that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make his steed some solace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gave him good forage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Ah, Saint Mary, <i>ben'dicite</i>,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Into his saddle he clomb anon,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Till he so long had ridden and gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he found in a privy wonne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
