				<h3 epub:type="title">The Prologue</h3>
				<p>
					<span>When that the Knight had thus his tale told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the rout was neither young nor old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he not said it was a noble story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worthy to be drawen to memory;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely the gentles every one.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host then laugh’d and swore, “So may I gon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This goes aright; unbuckled is the mail;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let see now who shall tell another tale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For truely this game is well begun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now telleth ye, Sir Monk, if that ye conne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Somewhat, to quiten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> with the Knighte’s tale.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Miller that fordrunken was all pale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> upon his horse he sat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would avalen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> neither hood nor hat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor abide<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> no man for his courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in Pilate’s voice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore by armes, and by blood, and bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I can a noble tale for the nones,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which I will now quite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> the Knighte’s tale.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host saw well how drunk he was of ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Robin, abide, my leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some better man shall tell us first another:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abide, and let us worke thriftily.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Godde’s soul,” quoth he, “that will not I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will speak, or elles go my way!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answer’d; “Tell on a devil way;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now hearken,” quoth the Miller, “all and some:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first I make a protestatioun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I am drunk, I know it by my soun’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore if that I misspeak or say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wite it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> the ale of Southwark, I you pray:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will tell a legend and a life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of a carpenter and of his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that a clerk hath set the wrighte’s cap.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Reeve answer’d and saide, “Stint thy clap,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let be thy lewed drunken harlotry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is a sin, and eke a great folly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To apeiren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> any man, or him defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke to bringe wives in evil name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou may’st enough of other thinges sayn.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This drunken Miller spake full soon again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide, “Leve brother Osewold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who hath no wife, he is no cuckold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I say not therefore that thou art one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There be full goode wives many one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why art thou angry with my tale now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have a wife, pardie, as well as thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet n’old<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> I, for the oxen in my plough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taken upon me more than enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To deemen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> of myself that I am one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will believe well that I am none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An husband should not be inquisitive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Godde’s privity, nor of his wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he may finde Godde’s foison<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the remnant needeth not to enquere.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What should I more say, but that this Millere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would his wordes for no man forbear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But told his churlish<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> tale in his mannere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me thinketh, that I shall rehearse it here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore every gentle wight I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s love to deem not that I say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of evil intent, but that I must rehearse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their tales all, be they better or worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles falsen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> some of my mattere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore whoso list it not to hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn o’er the leaf, and choose another tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he shall find enough, both great and smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of storial<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> thing that toucheth gentiless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke morality and holiness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blame not me, if that ye choose amiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Miller is a churl, ye know well this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was the Reeve, with many other mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And harlotry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> they tolde bothe two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Avise you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> now, and put me out of blame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke men should not make earnest of game.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>Whilom there was dwelling in Oxenford</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A riche gnof,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> that guestes held to board,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his craft he was a carpenter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him there was dwelling a poor scholer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had learned art, but all his fantasy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was turned for to learn astrology.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coude<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> a certain of conclusions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To deeme<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> by interrogations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that men asked him in certain hours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that men should have drought or elles show’rs:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or if men asked him what shoulde fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of everything, I may not reckon all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This clerk was called Hendy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> Nicholas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of derne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> love he knew and of solace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewith he was sly and full privy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like a maiden meek for to see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A chamber had he in that hostelry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone, withouten any company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fetisly y-dight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> with herbes swoot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he himself was sweet as is the root</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of liquorice, or any setewall.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Almagest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> and bookes great and small,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His astrolabe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a>belonging to his art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His augrim stones,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> layed fair apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On shelves couched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> at his bedde’s head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His press y-cover’d with a falding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> red.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all above there lay a gay psalt’ry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which he made at nightes melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweetely, that all the chamber rang:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And <i>Angelus ad virginem</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> he sang.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that he sung the kinge’s note;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full often blessed was his merry throat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus this sweete clerk his time spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his friendes finding and his rent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter had wedded new a wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that he loved more than his life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of eighteen year, I guess, she was of age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jealous he was, and held her narr’w in cage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was wild and young, and he was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And deemed himself belike<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> a cuckold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew not Cato,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> for his wit was rude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bade a man wed his similitude.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men shoulde wedden after their estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For youth and eld<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> are often at debate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since that he was fallen in the snare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must endure (as other folk) his care.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fair was this younge wife, and therewithal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any weasel her body gent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> and small.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A seint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> she weared, barred all of silk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A barm-cloth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> eke as white as morning milk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon her lendes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> full of many a gore.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>White was her smock,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and broider’d all before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke behind, on her collar about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of coal-black silk, within and eke without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tapes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> of her white volupere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were of the same suit of her collere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her fillet broad of silk, and set full high:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> she had a likerous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full small y-pulled were her browes two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they were bent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> and black as any sloe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was well more blissful on to see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is the newe perjenete<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And softer than the wool is of a wether.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by her girdle hung a purse of leather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tassel’d with silk, and pearled with latoun.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all this world to seeken up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no man so wise, that coude thenche<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So gay a popelot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> or such a wench.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full brighter was the shining of her hue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than in the Tower the noble<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> forged new.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of her song, it was as loud and yern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any swallow chittering on a bern.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> she coulde skip, and make a game,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any kid or calf following his dame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her mouth was sweet as braket,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a> or as methe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">39</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or hoard of apples, laid in hay or heath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wincing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">40</a> she was as is a jolly colt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A brooch she bare upon her low collere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As broad as is the boss of a bucklere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her shoon were laced on her legges high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was a primerole,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">41</a> a piggesnie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">42</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any lord t’ have ligging<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">43</a> in his bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or yet for any good yeoman to wed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, sir, and eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">44</a> sir, so befell the case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on a day this Hendy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">45</a> Nicholas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell with this younge wife to rage and play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">46</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that her husband was at Oseney,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">47</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As clerkes be full subtle and full quaint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he caught her by the queint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">48</a> but if I have my will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For derne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">49</a> love of thee, leman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">50</a> I spill.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">51</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And helde her fast by the haunche bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide “Leman, love me well at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I will dien, all so God me save.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she sprang as a colt doth in the trave:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her head she writhed fast away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I will not kiss thee, by my fay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why let be,” quoth she, “let be, Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I will cry out harow and alas!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do away your handes, for your courtesy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas gan mercy for to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spake so fair, and proffer’d him so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she her love him granted at the last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore her oath by Saint Thomas of Kent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she would be at his commandement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that she may her leisure well espy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My husband is so full of jealousy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> ye waite well, and be privy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot right well I am but dead,” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye muste be full derne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> as in this case.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, thereof care thee nought,” quoth Nicholas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A clerk had litherly beset his while,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> he could a carpenter beguile.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus they were accorded and y-sworn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wait a time, as I have said beforn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Nicholas had done thus every deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thwacked her about the lendes well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He kiss’d her sweet, and taketh his psalt’ry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And playeth fast, and maketh melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then fell it thus, that to the parish church,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Christe’s owen workes for to wirch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This good wife went upon a holy day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her forehead shone as bright as any day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was it washen, when she left her werk.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now was there of that church a parish clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which that was y-cleped Absolon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Curl’d was his hair, and as the gold it shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strutted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> as a fanne large and broad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full straight and even lay his jolly shode.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His rode<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> was red, his eyen grey as goose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Paule’s windows carven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> on his shoes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hosen red he went full fetisly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-clad he was full small and properly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All in a kirtle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> of a light waget;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fair and thicke be the pointes set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereupon he had a gay surplice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As white as is the blossom on the rise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A merry child he was, so God me save;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well could he letten blood, and clip, and shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make a charter of land, and a quittance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In twenty manners could he trip and dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the school of Oxenforde tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his legges caste to and fro;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And playen songes on a small ribible;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as well could he play on a gitern.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the town was brewhouse nor tavern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he not visited with his solas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as that any garnard tapstere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth to say he was somedeal squaimous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of farting, and of speeche dangerous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Absolon, that jolly was and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went with a censer on the holy day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Censing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> the wives of the parish fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a lovely look he on them cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> on this carpenter’s wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To look on her him thought a merry life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was so proper, and sweet, and likerous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he a cat, he would her hent anon.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This parish clerk, this jolly Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath in his hearte such a love-longing!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of no wife took he none offering;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For courtesy he said he woulde none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moon at night full clear and brighte shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon his gitern hath y-taken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For paramours he thoughte for to waken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went, jolif<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> and amorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he came to the carpentere’s house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little after the cock had y-crow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dressed him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> under a shot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> window,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was upon the carpentere’s wall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He singeth in his voice gentle and small;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>“Now, dear lady, if thy will be,</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>I pray that ye will rue<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> on me;”</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full well accordant to his giterning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spake unto his wife, and said anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What Alison, hear’st thou not Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That chanteth thus under our bower<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> wall?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she answer’d her husband therewithal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes, God wot, John, I hear him every deal.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This passeth forth; what will ye bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> than well?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day this jolly Absolon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wooeth her, that him is woebegone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He waketh all the night, and all the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To comb his lockes broad, and make him gay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wooeth her by means and by brocage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore he woulde be her owen page.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He singeth brokking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> as a nightingale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sent her piment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a> mead, and spiced ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wafers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> piping hot out of the glede:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for she was of town, he proffer’d meed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For some folk will be wonnen for richess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some for strokes, and some with gentiless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes, to show his lightness and mast’ry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He playeth Herod<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> on a scaffold high.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what availeth him as in this case?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So loveth she the Hendy Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Absolon may blow the bucke’s horn:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had for all his labour but a scorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus she maketh Absolon her ape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his earnest turneth to a jape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full sooth is this proverb, it is no lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men say right thus alway; the nighe sly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maketh oft time the far lief to be loth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though that Absolon be wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> or wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that he far was from her sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This nigh Nicholas stood still in his light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now bear thee well, thou Hendy Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Absolon may wail and sing “Alas!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell, that on a Saturday</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter was gone to Oseney,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Hendy Nicholas and Alison</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accorded were to this conclusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Nicholas shall shape him a wile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silly jealous husband to beguile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if so were the game went aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shoulde sleepen in his arms all night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this was her desire and his also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon, withoute wordes mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas no longer would he tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But doth full soft unto his chamber carry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both meat and drinke for a day or tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to her husband bade her for to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that he asked after Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shoulde say, “She wist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> not where he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the day she saw him not with eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She trowed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> he was in some malady,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no cry that her maiden could him call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would answer, for nought that might befall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus passed forth all thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> Saturday,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ate, and slept, and didde what him list</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Sunday, that the sunne went to rest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly carpenter had great marvaill<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Nicholas, or what thing might him ail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I am adrad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> by Saint Thomas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It standeth not aright with Nicholas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God shielde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> that he died suddenly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This world is now full fickle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> sickerly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw to-day a corpse y-borne to chirch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That now on Monday last I saw him wirch.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go up,” quod he unto his knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> “anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clepe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> at his door, or knocke with a stone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look how it is, and tell me boldely.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knave went him up full sturdily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, at the chamber door while that he stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried and knocked as that he were wood:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What how? what do ye, Master Nicholay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How may ye sleepen all the longe day?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all for nought, he hearde not a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An hole he found full low upon the board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> the cat was wont in for to creep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at that hole he looked in full deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last he had of him a sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas sat ever gaping upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he had kyked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> on the newe moon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown he went, and told his master soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In what array he saw this ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> man.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter to blissen him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Now help us, Sainte Frideswide.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man wot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> little what shall him betide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This man is fall’n with his astronomy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into some woodness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> or some agony.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought aye well how that it shoulde be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men should know nought of Godde’s privity.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, blessed be alway a lewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That nought but only his believe can.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So far’d another clerk with astronomy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He walked in the fieldes for to pry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> the starres, what there should befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he was in a marle pit y-fall.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw not that. But yet, by Saint Thomas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me rueth sore of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> Hendy Nicholas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall be rated of his studying,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that I may, by Jesus, heaven’s king!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Get me a staff, that I may underspore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that thou, Robin, heavest off the door:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall out of his studying, as I guess.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the chamber door he gan him dress.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His knave was a strong carl for the nonce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the hasp<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a> he heav’d it off at once;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the floor the door fell down anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas sat aye as still as stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever he gap’d upward into the air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carpenter ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> he were in despair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a> him by the shoulders mightily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shook him hard, and cried spitously;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, Nicholas? what how, man? look adown:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awake, and think on Christe’s passioun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I crouche thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">39</a> from elves, and from wights.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">40</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therewith the night-spell said he anon rights,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">41</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the four halves<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">42</a> of the house about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the threshold of the door without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lord Jesus Christ, and Sainte Benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blesse this house from every wicked wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the night mare, the white Pater-noster;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where wonnest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> thou now, Sainte Peter’s sister?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last this Hendy Nicholas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan for to sigh full sore, and said; “Alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall all time world be lost eftsoones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> now?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter answer’d; “What sayest thou?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? think on God, as we do, men that swink.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas answer’d; “Fetch me a drink;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after will I speak in privity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of certain thing that toucheth thee and me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will tell it no other man certain.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter went down, and came again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brought of mighty ale a large quart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that each of them had drunk his part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas his chamber door fast shet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down the carpenter by him he set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; “John, mine host full lief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> and dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt upon thy truthe swear me here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to no wight thou shalt my counsel wray:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it is Christes counsel that I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou tell it man, thou art forlore:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this vengeance thou shalt have therefor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if thou wraye<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> me, thou shalt be wood.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, Christ forbid it for his holy blood!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth then this silly man; “I am no blab,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor, though I say it, am I lief to gab.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say what thou wilt, I shall it never tell</span>

					<span>To child or wife, by him that harried Hell.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now, John,” quoth Nicholas, “I will not lie,</span>

					<span>I have y-found in my astrology,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have looked in the moone bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That now on Monday next, at quarter night,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That never half so great was Noe’s flood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This world,” he said, “in less than half an hour</span>

					<span>Shall all be dreint,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> so hideous is the shower:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus shall mankinde drench,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> and lose their life.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter answer’d; “Alas, my wife!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shall she drench? alas, mine Alisoun!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sorrow of this he fell almost adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Is there no remedy in this case?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why, yes, for God,” quoth Hendy Nicholas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thou wilt worken after lore and rede;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou may’st not worken after thine own head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thus saith Solomon, that was full true:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Work all by counsel, and thou shalt not rue.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou worke wilt by good counseil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I undertake, withoute mast or sail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet shall I save her, and thee, and me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast thou not heard how saved was Noe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that our Lord had warned him beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the world with water should be lorn?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes,” quoth this carpenter,” full yore ago.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hast thou not heard,” quoth Nicholas, “also</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sorrow of Noe, with his fellowship,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he had ere he got his wife to ship?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>

					<span>Him had been lever,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> I dare well undertake,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That she had had a ship herself alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore know’st thou what is best to be done?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This asketh haste, and of an hasty thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may not preach or make tarrying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon go get us fast into this inn<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>For each of us; but look that they be large,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In whiche we may swim as in a barge:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have therein vitaille suffisant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for one day; fie on the remenant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water shall aslake<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> and go away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboute prime<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> upon the nexte day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Robin may not know of this, thy knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor eke thy maiden Gill I may not save:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ask me not why: for though thou aske me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not telle Godde’s privity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sufficeth thee, but if thy wit be mad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have as great a grace as Noe had;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy wife shall I well saven out of doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go now thy way, and speed thee hereabout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when thou hast for her, and thee, and me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-gotten us these kneading tubbes three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shalt thou hang them in the roof full high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that no man our purveyance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> espy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when thou hast done thus as I have said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hast our vitaille fair in them y-laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke an axe to smite the cord in two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the water comes, that we may go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And break an hole on high upon the gable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the garden-ward, over the stable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may freely passe forth our way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the greate shower is gone away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shalt thou swim as merry, I undertake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth the white duck after her drake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will I clepe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> ‘How, Alison? How, John?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be merry: for the flood will pass anon.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou wilt say, ‘Hail, Master Nicholay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good-morrow, I see thee well, for it is day.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then shall we be lordes all our life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the world, as Noe and his wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of one thing I warne thee full right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be well advised, on that ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we be enter’d into shippe’s board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none of us not speak a single word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor clepe nor cry, but be in his prayere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that is Godde’s owen heste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy wife and thou must hangen far atween,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that betwixte you shall be no sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more in looking than there shall in deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This ordinance is said: go, God thee speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To-morrow night, when men be all asleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into our kneading tubbes will we creep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sitte there, abiding Godde’s grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go now thy way, I have no longer space</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make of this no longer sermoning:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men say thus: Send the wise, and say nothing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art so wise, it needeth thee nought teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, save our lives, and that I thee beseech.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This silly carpenter went forth his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft he said, “Alas! and Well-a-day!,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his wife he told his privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she was ware, and better knew than he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What all this quainte cast was for to say.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless she fear’d as she would dey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Alas! go forth thy way anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help us to scape, or we be dead each one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am thy true and very wedded wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, deare spouse, and help to save our life.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, what a great thing is affection!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may die of imagination,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So deeply may impression be take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly carpenter begins to quake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thinketh verily that he may see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This newe flood come weltering as the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To drenchen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> Alison, his honey dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He weepeth, waileth, maketh sorry cheer;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sigheth, with full many a sorry sough.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He go’th, and getteth him a kneading trough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that a tub, and a kemelin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he sent them to his inn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hung them in the roof full privily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his own hand then made he ladders three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To climbe by the ranges and the stalks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the tubbes hanging in the balks;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And victualed them, kemelin, trough, and tub,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With bread and cheese, and good ale in a jub,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sufficing right enough as for a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ere that he had made all this array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sent his knave, and eke his wench<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his need<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> to London for to go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the Monday, when it drew to night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shut his door withoute candle light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dressed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> every thing as it should be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shortly up they climbed all the three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They satte stille well a furlong way.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, <i>Pater noster</i>, clum,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> said Nicholay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And “clum,” quoth John; and “clum,” said Alison:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter said his devotion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still he sat and bidded his prayere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awaking on the rain, if he it hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deade sleep, for weary business,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell on this carpenter, right as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the curfew-time,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> or little more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For travail of his ghost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> he groaned sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eft he routed, for his head mislay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown the ladder stalked Nicholay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Alison full soft adown she sped.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute wordes more they went to bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> the carpenter was wont to lie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was the revel, and the melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus lay Alison and Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In business of mirth and in solace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the bell of <i>laudes</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> gan to ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And friars in the chancel went to sing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is for love alway so woebegone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the Monday was at Oseney</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With company, him to disport and play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked upon cas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> a cloisterer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily after John the carpenter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he drew him apart out of the church,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “I n’ot;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> I saw him not here wirch<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since Saturday; I trow that he be went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For timber, where our abbot hath him sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dwellen at the Grange a day or two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he is wont for timber for to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else he is at his own house certain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where that he be, I cannot soothly sayn.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon full jolly was and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “Now is the time to wake all night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> I saw him not stirring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his door, since day began to spring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So may I thrive, but I shall at cock crow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily go knock at his window,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That stands full low upon his bower wall:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Alison then will I tellen all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My love-longing; for I shall not miss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at the leaste way I shall her kiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some manner comfort shall I have, parfay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mouth hath itched all this livelong day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is a sign of kissing at the least.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All night I mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> eke I was at a feast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I will go sleep an hour or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the night then will I wake and play.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the first cock crowed had, anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up rose this jolly lover Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him arrayed gay, at point devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first he chewed grains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> and liquorice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To smelle sweet, ere he had combed his hair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his tongue a true love<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> he bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thereby thought he to be gracious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then came he to the carpentere’s house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still he stood under the shot window;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his breast it raught,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> it was so low;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And soft he coughed with a semisoun’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What do ye, honeycomb, sweet Alisoun?</span>

					<span>My faire bird, my sweet cinamome,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awaken, leman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> mine, and speak to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full little thinke ye upon my woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for your love I sweat there as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> I go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No wonder is that I do swelt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> and sweat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mourn as doth a lamb after the teat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> leman, I have such love-longing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like a turtle true is my mourning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not eat, no more than a maid.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go from the window, thou jack fool,” she said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“As help me God, it will not be, ‘come ba me.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I love another, else I were to blame,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well better than thee, by Jesus, Absolon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go forth thy way, or I will cast a stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let me sleep; a twenty devil way.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth Absolon, “and well away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That true love ever was so ill beset:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then kiss me, since that it may be no bet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Jesus’ love, and for the love of me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Wilt thou then go thy way therewith?” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, certes, leman,” quoth this Absolon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Then make thee ready,” quoth she, “I come anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>[And unto Nicholas she said full still:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now peace, and thou shalt laugh anon thy fill.”]</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon down set him on his knees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I am a lord at all degrees:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For after this I hope there cometh more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leman, thy grace, and, sweete bird, thine ore.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The window she undid, and that in haste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Have done,” quoth she, “come off, and speed thee fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest that our neighebours should thee espy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Absolon gan wipe his mouth full dry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark was the night as pitch or as the coal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the window she put out her hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon him fell ne bet ne werse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with his mouth he kiss’d her naked erse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full savourly. When he was ware of this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aback he start, and thought it was amiss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well he wist a woman hath no beard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He felt a thing all rough, and long y-hair’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; “Fy, alas! what have I do?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Te he!” quoth she, and clapt the window to;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon went forth at sorry pace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A beard, a beard,” said Hendy Nicholas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God’s <i>corpus</i>, this game went fair and well.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly Absolon heard every deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his lip he gan for anger bite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to himself he said, “I shall thee quite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

					<span>For from that time that he had kiss’d her erse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of paramours he sette not a kers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was healed of his malady;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full often paramours he gan defy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weep as doth a child that hath been beat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A softe pace he went over the street</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a smith, men callen Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> Gerveis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his forge smithed plough-harness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sharped share and culter busily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon knocked all easily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Undo, Gerveis, and that anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, who art thou?” “It is I, Absolon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What? Absolon, what? Christe’s sweete tree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why rise so rath?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> hey! <i>Benedicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What aileth you? some gay girl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> God it wote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath brought you thus upon the viretote:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Saint Neot, ye wot well what I mean.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon he raughte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> not a bean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all his play; no word again he gaf,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had more tow on his distaff<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than Gerveis knew, and saide; “Friend so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hote culter in the chimney here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lend it to me, I have therewith to don:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will it bring again to thee full soon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gerveis answered; “Certes, were it gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in a poke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> nobles all untold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shouldst it have, as I am a true smith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hey! Christe’s foot, what will ye do therewith?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thereof,” quoth Absolon, “be as be may;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall well tell it thee another day:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caught the culter by the colde stele.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full soft out at the door he gan to steal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went unto the carpentere’s wall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coughed first, and knocked therewithal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the window, light as he did ere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Alison answered; “Who is there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That knocketh so? I warrant him a thief.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, nay,” quoth he, “God wot, my sweete lefe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am thine Absolon, my own darling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gold,” quoth he, “I have thee brought a ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mother gave it me, so God me save!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fine it is, and thereto well y-grave:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This will I give to thee, if thou me kiss.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Nicholas was risen up to piss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought he would amenden all the jape;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shoulde kiss his erse ere that he scape:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up the window did he hastily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out his erse he put full privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the buttock, to the haunche bone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewith spake this clerk, this Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Speak, sweete bird, I know not where thou art.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas anon let fly a fart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As great as it had been a thunder dent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with the stroke he was well nigh y-blent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was ready with his iron hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Nicholas amid the erse he smote.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Off went the skin an handbreadth all about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hote culter burned so his tout,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for the smart he weened<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> he would die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> for woe he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Help! water, water, help for Godde’s heart!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter out of his slumber start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard one cry “Water,” as he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “Alas! now cometh Noe’s flood.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sat him up withoute wordes mo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his axe he smote the cord in two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down went all; he found neither to sell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor bread nor ale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> till he came to the sell,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the floor, and there in swoon he lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up started Alison and Nicholay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cried out an “harow!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in the street.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The neighbours alle, bothe small and great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In ranne, for to gauren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> on this man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That yet in swoone lay, both pale and wan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with the fall he broken had his arm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But stand he must unto his owen harm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when he spake, he was anon borne down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Hendy Nicholas and Alisoun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They told to every man that he was wood;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was aghaste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> so of Noe’s flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through phantasy, that of his vanity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had y-bought him kneading-tubbes three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had them hanged in the roof above;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that he prayed them for Godde’s love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sitten in the roof for company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk gan laughen at his phantasy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the roof they kyken,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and they gape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turned all his harm into a jape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whatsoe’er this carpenter answer’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was for nought, no man his reason heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With oathes great he was so sworn adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was holden wood in all the town.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every clerk anon right held with other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They said, “The man was wood, my leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> brother;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every wight gan laughen at his strife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus swived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> was the carpentere’s wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all his keeping<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> and his jealousy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon hath kiss’d her nether eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Nicholas is scalded in the tout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This tale is done, and God save all the rout.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
