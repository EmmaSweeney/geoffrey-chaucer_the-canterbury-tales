				<p>
					<span>Our Host upon his stirrups stood anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; "Good men, hearken every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was a thrifty* tale for the nones. *discreet, profitable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Parish Priest," quoth he, "for Godde's bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us a tale, as was thy *forword yore:* *promise formerly*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see well that ye learned men in lore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can* muche good, by Godde's dignity." *know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Parson him answer'd, "Ben'dicite!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ails the man, so sinfully to swear?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answer'd, "O Jankin, be ye there?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, good men," quoth our Host, "hearken to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I smell a Lollard &lt;2&gt; in the wind," quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Abide, for Godde's digne* passion, *worthy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For we shall have a predication:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Lollard here will preachen us somewhat."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Nay, by my father's soul, that shall he not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide the Shipman; "Here shall he not preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall no gospel glose* here nor teach. *comment upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all believe in the great God," quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"He woulde sowe some difficulty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or springe cockle &lt;3&gt; in our cleane corn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, Host, I warne thee beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My jolly body shall a tale tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I shall clinke you so merry a bell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I shall waken all this company;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it shall not be of philosophy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor of physic, nor termes quaint of law;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is but little Latin in my maw."* *belly</span>

				<p>Notes to the Prologue to the Shipman's Tale</p>
				<p>1. The Prologue here given was transferred by Tyrwhitt from the place, preceding the Squire's Tale, which it had formerly occupied; the Shipman's Tale having no Prologue in the best manuscripts.</p>
				<p>2. Lollard: A contemptuous name for the followers of Wyckliffe; presumably derived from the Latin, "lolium," tares, as if they were the tares among the Lord's wheat; so, a few lines below, the Shipman intimates his fear lest the Parson should "spring cockle in our clean corn."</p>
				<p>3. Cockle: A weed, the "Agrostemma githago" of Linnaeus; perhaps named from the Anglo-Saxon, "ceocan," because it chokes the corn. (Transcriber's note: It is also possible Chaucer had in mind Matthew 13:25, where in some translations, an enemy sowed "cockle" amongst the wheat. (Other translations have "tares" and "darnel".))</p>

				<p>
					<span>A Merchant whilom dwell'd at Saint Denise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That riche was, for which men held him wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife he had of excellent beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And *companiable and revellous* was she, *fond of society and</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is a thing that causeth more dispence merry making*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than worth is all the cheer and reverence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That men them do at feastes and at dances.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such salutations and countenances</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passen, as doth the shadow on the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put woe is him that paye must for all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sely* husband algate** he must pay, *innocent **always</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must us &lt;2&gt; clothe and he must us array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All for his owen worship richely:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which array we dance jollily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he may not, paraventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles list not such dispence endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then must another paye for our cost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This noble merchant held a noble house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he had all day so great repair,* *resort of visitors</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his largesse, and for his wife was fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wonder is; but hearken to my tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amonges all these guestes great and smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was a monk, a fair man and a bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow a thirty winter he was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever-in-one* was drawing to that place. *constantly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This younge monk, that was so fair of face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Acquainted was so with this goode man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that their firste knowledge began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his house as familiar was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it is possible any friend to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for as muchel as this goode man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke this monk of which that I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were both the two y-born in one village,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The monk *him claimed, as for cousinage,* *claimed kindred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he again him said not once nay, with him*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But was as glad thereof as fowl of day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"For to his heart it was a great pleasance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they knit with etern' alliance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them gan other to assure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of brotherhood while that their life may dure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free was Dan &lt;3&gt; John, and namely* of dispence,** *especially **spending</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in that house, and full of diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do pleasance, and also *great costage;* *liberal outlay*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He not forgot to give the leaste page</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all that house; but, after their degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave the lord, and sithen* his meinie,** *afterwards **servants</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he came, some manner honest thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which they were as glad of his coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fowl is fain when that the sun upriseth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more of this as now, for it sufficeth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But so befell, this merchant on a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shope* him to make ready his array *resolved, arranged</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the town of Bruges &lt;4&gt; for to fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To buye there a portion of ware;* *merchandise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he hath to Paris sent anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A messenger, and prayed hath Dan John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he should come to Saint Denis, and play* *enjoy himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him, and with his wife, a day or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he to Bruges went, in alle wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble monk, of which I you devise,* *tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had of his abbot, as him list, licence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Because he was a man of high prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke an officer out for to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see their granges and their barnes wide); &lt;5&gt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto Saint Denis he came anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was so welcome as my lord Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our deare cousin, full of courtesy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him he brought a jub* of malvesie, *jug</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke another full of fine vernage, &lt;6&gt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And volatile,* as aye was his usage: *wild-fowl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus I let them eat, and drink, and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This merchant and this monk, a day or tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thirde day the merchant up ariseth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his needeis sadly him adviseth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up into his countour-house* went he, *counting-house &lt;7&gt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reckon with himself as well may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of thilke* year, how that it with him stood, *that</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how that he dispended bad his good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he increased were or non.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bookes and his bagges many a one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He laid before him on his counting-board.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full riche was his treasure and his hoard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which full fast his countour door he shet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke he would that no man should him let* *hinder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his accountes, for the meane time:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he sat, till it was passed prime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dan John was risen in the morn also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the garden walked to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had his thinges said full courteously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The good wife came walking full privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the garden, where he walked soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him saluted, as she had done oft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A maiden child came in her company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which as her list she might govern and gie,* *guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet under the yarde* was the maid. *rod &lt;8&gt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"O deare cousin mine, Dan John," she said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"What aileth you so rath* for to arise?" *early</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Niece," quoth he, "it ought enough suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five houres for to sleep upon a night;'</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But* it were for an old appalled** wight, *unless **pallid, wasted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be these wedded men, that lie and dare,* *stare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a forme sits a weary hare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alle forstraught* with houndes great and smale; *distracted, confounded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, deare niece, why be ye so pale?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trowe certes that our goode man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath you so laboured, since this night began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you were need to reste hastily."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he laugh'd full merrily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his owen thought he wax'd all red.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This faire wife gan for to shake her head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide thus; "Yea, God wot all" quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Nay, cousin mine, it stands not so with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by that God, that gave me soul and life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the realm of France is there no wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lesse lust hath to that sorry play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I may sing alas and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I was born; but to no wight," quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Dare I not tell how that it stands with me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I think out of this land to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles of myself to make an end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So full am I of dread and eke of care."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This monk began upon this wife to stare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, "Alas! my niece, God forbid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye for any sorrow, or any dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fordo* yourself: but telle me your grief, *destroy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paraventure I may, in your mischief,* *distress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Counsel or help; and therefore telle me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All your annoy, for it shall be secre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For on my portos* here I make an oath, *breviary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never in my life, *for lief nor loth,* *willing or unwilling*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne shall I of no counsel you bewray."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"The same again to you," quoth she, "I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God and by this portos I you swear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though men me woulden all in pieces tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne shall I never, for* to go to hell, *though I should</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bewray* one word of thing that ye me tell, *betray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no cousinage, nor alliance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But verily for love and affiance."* *confidence, promise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they sworn, and thereupon they kiss'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them told other what them list.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Cousin," quoth she, "if that I hadde space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have none, and namely* in this place, *specially</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would I tell a legend of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I have suffer'd since I was a wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mine husband, all* be he your cousin. *although</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Nay," quoth this monk, "by God and Saint Martin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is no more cousin unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is the leaf that hangeth on the tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I call him so, by Saint Denis of France,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the more cause of acquaintance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of you, which I have loved specially</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboven alle women sickerly,* *surely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This swear I you *on my professioun;* *by my vows of religion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me your grief, lest that he come adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hasten you, and go away anon."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"My deare love," quoth she, "O my Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full lief* were me this counsel for to hide, *pleasant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But out it must, I may no more abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My husband is to me the worste man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever was since that the world began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I am a wife, it sits* not me *becomes</span>

					<span>To telle no wight of our privity,</span>

					<span>Neither in bed, nor in none other place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God shield* I shoulde tell it for his grace; *forbid</span>

					<span>A wife shall not say of her husband</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all honour, as I can understand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save unto you thus much I telle shall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As help me God, he is nought worth at all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In no degree, the value of a fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet me grieveth most his niggardy.* *stinginess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well ye wot, that women naturally</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But, by that ilke* Lord that for us bled, *same</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his honour myself for to array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Sunday next I muste needes pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred francs, or elles am I lorn.* *ruined, undone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet *were me lever* that I were unborn, *I would rather*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than me were done slander or villainy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if mine husband eke might it espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I were but lost; and therefore I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lend me this sum, or elles must I dey.* *die</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John, I say, lend me these hundred francs;</span>

					<span>Pardie, I will not faile you, *my thanks,* *if I can help it*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that you list to do that I you pray;</span>

					<span>And do to you what pleasance and service</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may do, right as you list devise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but* I do, God take on me vengeance, *unless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As foul as e'er had Ganilion &lt;9&gt; of France."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This gentle monk answer'd in this mannere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Now truely, mine owen lady dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have," quoth he, "on you so greate ruth,* *pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I you swear, and plighte you my truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That when your husband is to Flanders fare,* *gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will deliver you out of this care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will bringe you a hundred francs."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he caught her by the flanks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her embraced hard, and kissed her oft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Go now your way," quoth he, "all still and soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let us dine as soon as that ye may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by my cylinder* 'tis prime of day; *portable sundial</span>

					<span>Go now, and be as true as I shall be ."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Now elles God forbidde, Sir," quoth she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth she went, as jolly as a pie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade the cookes that they should them hie,* *make haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that men mighte dine, and that anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to her husband is this wife gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knocked at his contour boldely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>*"Qui est la?"* quoth he. "Peter! it am I," *who is there?*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth she; "What, Sir, how longe all will ye fast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How longe time will ye reckon and cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your summes, and your bookes, and your things?</span>

					<span>Ye have enough, pardie, of Godde's sond.* *sending, gifts</span>

					<span>What? let us hear a mass, and go we dine."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Wife," quoth this man, "little canst thou divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The curious businesse that we have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of us chapmen,* all so God me save, *merchants</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Till we be dead, or elles that we play</span>

					<span>That to a thrifty household may suffice.</span>

					<span>Thee lacketh none array, nor no vitail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silver in thy purse thou shalt not fail."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And with that word his contour door he shet,* *shut</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down he went; no longer would he let;* *delay, hinder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily a mass was there said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speedily the tables were laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the dinner faste they them sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And richely this monk the chapman fed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after dinner Dan John soberly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This chapman took apart, and privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said him thus: "Cousin, it standeth so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, well I see, to Bruges ye will go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God and Saint Austin speede you and guide.</span>

					<span>I pray you, cousin, wisely that ye ride:</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Farewell, cousin, God shielde you from care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any thing there be, by day or night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it lie in my power and my might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye me will command in any wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It shall be done, right as ye will devise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one thing ere ye go, if it may be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I woulde pray you for to lend to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred frankes, for a week or twy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certain beastes that I muste buy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To store with a place that is ours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(God help me so, I would that it were yours);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall not faile surely of my day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for a thousand francs, a mile way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let this thing be secret, I you pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet to-night these beastes must I buy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fare now well, mine owen cousin dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>*Grand mercy* of your cost and of your cheer." *great thanks*</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This noble merchant gentilly* anon *like a gentleman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer'd and said, "O cousin mine, Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now sickerly this is a small request:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My gold is youres, when that it you lest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not only my gold, but my chaffare;* *merchandise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take what you list, *God shielde that ye spare.* *God forbid that you</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one thing is, ye know it well enow should take too little*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of chapmen, that their money is their plough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We may creance* while we have a name, *obtain credit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But goldless for to be it is no game.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pay it again when it lies in your ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After my might full fain would I you please."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These hundred frankes set he forth anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he took them to Dan John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No wight in all this world wist of this loan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saving the merchant and Dan John alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They drink, and speak, and roam a while, and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that Dan John rode unto his abbay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The morrow came, and forth this merchant rideth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Flanders-ward, his prentice well him guideth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he came unto Bruges merrily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now went this merchant fast and busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his need, and buyed and creanced;* *got credit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He neither played at the dice, nor danced;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as a merchant, shortly for to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He led his life; and there I let him dwell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Sunday next* the merchant was y-gone, *after</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Saint Denis y-comen is Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crown and beard all fresh and newly shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the house was not so little a knave,* *servant-boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor no wight elles that was not full fain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that my lord Dan John was come again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shortly to the point right for to gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The faire wife accorded with Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for these hundred francs he should all night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have her in his armes bolt upright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this accord performed was in deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mirth all night a busy life they lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it was day, that Dan John went his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade the meinie* "Farewell; have good day." *servants</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For none of them, nor no wight in the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had of Dan John right no suspicioun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he rode home to his abbay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or where him list; no more of him I say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The merchant, when that ended was the fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Saint Denis he gan for to repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his wife he made feast and cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tolde her that chaffare* was so dear, *merchandise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That needes must he make a chevisance;* *loan &lt;11&gt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was bound in a recognisance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To paye twenty thousand shields* anon. *crowns, ecus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which this merchant is to Paris gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To borrow of certain friendes that he had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A certain francs, and some with him he lad.* *took</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he was come into the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For great cherte* and great affectioun *love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto Dan John he wente first to play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for to borrow of him no money,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bat for to weet* and see of his welfare, *know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to telle him of his chaffare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As friendes do, when they be met in fere.* *company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John him made feast and merry cheer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he him told again full specially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he had well y-bought and graciously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Thanked be God) all whole his merchandise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that he must, in alle manner wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maken a chevisance, as for his best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then he shoulde be in joy and rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John answered, "Certes, I am fain* *glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye in health be come borne again:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that I were rich, as have I bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of twenty thousand shields should ye not miss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ye so kindely the other day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lente me gold, and as I can and may</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thanke you, by God and by Saint Jame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless I took unto our Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your wife at home, the same gold again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon your bench; she wot it well, certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By certain tokens that I can her tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, by your leave, I may no longer dwell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our abbot will out of this town anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his company I muste gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greet well our Dame, mine owen niece sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And farewell, deare cousin, till we meet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This merchant, which that was full ware and wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>*Creanced hath,* and paid eke in Paris *had obtained credit*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To certain Lombards ready in their hond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sum of gold, and got of them his bond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And home he went, merry as a popinjay.* *parrot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well he knew he stood in such array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That needes must he win in that voyage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand francs, above all his costage.* *expenses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife full ready met him at the gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she was wont of old usage algate* *always</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that night in mirthe they beset;* *spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was rich, and clearly out of debt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it was day, the merchant gan embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife all new, and kiss'd her in her face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up he went, and maked it full tough.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"No more," quoth she, "by God ye have enough;"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wantonly again with him she play'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at the last this merchant to her said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"By God," quoth he, "I am a little wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With you, my wife, although it be me loth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wot ye why? by God, as that I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye have made a *manner strangeness* *a kind of estrangement*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixte me and my cousin, Dan John.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye should have warned me, ere I had gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he you had a hundred frankes paid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By ready token; he *had him evil apaid* *was displeased*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that I to him spake of chevisance,* *borrowing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(He seemed so as by his countenance);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, by God of heaven king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thoughte not to ask of him no thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray thee, wife, do thou no more so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me alway, ere that I from thee go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any debtor hath in mine absence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-payed thee, lest through thy negligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I might him ask a thing that he hath paid."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This wife was not afeared nor afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But boldely she said, and that anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Mary! I defy that false monk Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I keep* not of his tokens never a deal:** *care **whit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took me certain gold, I wot it well. —</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? evil thedom* on his monke's snout! — *thriving</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God it wot, I ween'd withoute doubt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he had given it me, because of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do therewith mine honour and my prow,* *profit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For cousinage, and eke for belle cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he hath had full often here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I see I stand in such disjoint,* *awkward position</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will answer you shortly to the point.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have more slacke debtors than am I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will pay you well and readily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day, and if so be I fail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am your wife, score it upon my tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I shall pay as soon as ever I may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, by my troth, I have on mine array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not in waste, bestow'd it every deal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for I have bestowed it so well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For your honour, for Godde's sake I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be not wroth, but let us laugh and play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall my jolly body have *to wed;* *in pledge*</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I will not pay you but in bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive it me, mine owen spouse dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn hitherward, and make better cheer."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The merchant saw none other remedy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to chide, it were but a folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that the thing might not amended be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Now, wife," he said, "and I forgive it thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by thy life be no more so large;* *liberal, lavish</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep better my good, this give I thee in charge."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus endeth now my tale; and God us send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taling enough, until our lives' end!</span>

				<p>Notes to the Shipman's Tale</p>
				<p>1. In this Tale Chaucer seems to have followed an old French story, which also formed the groundwork of the first story in the eighth day of the "Decameron."</p>
				<p>2. "He must us clothe": So in all the manuscripts and from this and the following lines, it must be inferred that Chaucer had intended to put the Tale in the mouth of a female speaker.</p>
				<p>3. Dan: a title bestowed on priests and scholars; from "Dominus," like the Spanish "Don".</p>
				<p>4. Bruges was in Chaucer's time the great emporium of European commerce.</p>
				<p>5. The monk had been appointed by his abbot to inspect and manage the rural property of the monastery.</p>
				<p>6. Malvesie or Malmesy wine derived its name from Malvasia, a region of the Morea near Cape Malea, where it was made, as it also was on Chios and some other Greek islands. Vernage was "vernaccia", a sweet Italian wine.</p>
				<p>7. Contour-house: counting-house; French, "comptoir."</p>
				<p>8. Under the yarde: under the rod; in pupillage; a phrase properly used of children, but employed by the Clerk in the prologue to his tale. See note 1 to the Prologue to the Clerk's Tale.</p>
				<p>9. Genelon, Ganelon, or Ganilion; one of Charlemagne's officers, whose treachery was the cause of the disastrous defeat of the Christians by the Saracens at Roncevalles; he was torn to pieces by four horses.</p>
				<p>10. Elenge: From French, "eloigner," to remove; it may mean either the lonely, cheerless condition of the priest, or the strange behaviour of the merchant in leaving him to himself.</p>
				<p>11. Make a chevisance: raise money by means of a borrowing agreement; from French, "achever," to finish; the general meaning of the word is a bargain, an agreement.</p>
