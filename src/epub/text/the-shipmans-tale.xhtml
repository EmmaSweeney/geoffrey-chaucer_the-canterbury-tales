				<p>
					<span>Our Host upon his stirrups stood anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; “Good men, hearken every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was a thrifty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> tale for the nones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Parish Priest,” quoth he, “for Godde’s bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us a tale, as was thy forword yore:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see well that ye learned men in lore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> muche good, by Godde’s dignity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Parson him answer’d, “<i>Ben’dicite!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ails the man, so sinfully to swear?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answer’d, “O Jankin, be ye there?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, good men,” quoth our Host, “hearken to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I smell a Lollard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> in the wind,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Abide, for Godde’s digne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> passion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For we shall have a predication:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Lollard here will preachen us somewhat.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, by my father’s soul, that shall he not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide the Shipman; “Here shall he not preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall no gospel glose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> here nor teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all believe in the great God,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He woulde sowe some difficulty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or springe cockle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> in our cleane corn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, Host, I warne thee beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My jolly body shall a tale tell,</span>

				<p>
					<span>A Merchant whilom dwell’d at Saint Denise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That riche was, for which men held him wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife he had of excellent beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And companiable and revellous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> was she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is a thing that causeth more dispence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than worth is all the cheer and reverence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That men them do at feastes and at dances.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such salutations and countenances</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passen, as doth the shadow on the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put woe is him that paye must for all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> husband algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> he must pay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must us<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> clothe and he must us array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All for his owen worship richely:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which array we dance jollily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he may not, paraventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles list not such dispence endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then must another paye for our cost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This noble merchant held a noble house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he had all day so great repair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his largesse, and for his wife was fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wonder is; but hearken to my tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amonges all these guestes great and smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was a monk, a fair man and a bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow a thirty winter he was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever-in-one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> was drawing to that place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This younge monk, that was so fair of face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Acquainted was so with this goode man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that their firste knowledge began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his house as familiar was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it is possible any friend to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for as muchel as this goode man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke this monk of which that I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were both the two y-born in one village,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The monk him claimed, as for cousinage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he again him said not once nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But was as glad thereof as fowl of day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For to his heart it was a great pleasance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they knit with etern’ alliance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them gan other to assure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of brotherhood while that their life may dure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free was Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> John, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> of dispence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in that house, and full of diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do pleasance, and also great costage;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He not forgot to give the leaste page</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all that house; but, after their degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave the lord, and sithen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> his meinie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he came, some manner honest thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which they were as glad of his coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fowl is fain when that the sun upriseth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more of this as now, for it sufficeth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But so befell, this merchant on a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> him to make ready his array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the town of Bruges for to fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To buye there a portion of ware;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he hath to Paris sent anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A messenger, and prayed hath Dan John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he should come to Saint Denis, and play<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him, and with his wife, a day or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he to Bruges went, in alle wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble monk, of which I you devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had of his abbot, as him list, licence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Because he was a man of high prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke an officer out for to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see their granges and their barnes wide);<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto Saint Denis he came anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was so welcome as my lord Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our deare cousin, full of courtesy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him he brought a jub<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> of malvesie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke another full of fine vernage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And volatile,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> as aye was his usage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus I let them eat, and drink, and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This merchant and this monk, a day or tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thirde day the merchant up ariseth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his needeis sadly him adviseth;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up into his countour-house<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> went he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reckon with himself as well may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> year, how that it with him stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how that he dispended bad his good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he increased were or non.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bookes and his bagges many a one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He laid before him on his counting-board.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full riche was his treasure and his hoard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which full fast his countour door he shet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke he would that no man should him let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his accountes, for the meane time:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he sat, till it was passed prime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dan John was risen in the morn also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the garden walked to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had his thinges said full courteously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The good wife came walking full privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the garden, where he walked soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him saluted, as she had done oft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A maiden child came in her company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which as her list she might govern and gie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet under the yarde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> was the maid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O deare cousin mine, Dan John,” she said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What aileth you so rath<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> for to arise?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Niece,” quoth he, “it ought enough suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five houres for to sleep upon a night;’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> it were for an old appalled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be these wedded men, that lie and dare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a forme sits a weary hare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alle forstraught<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> with houndes great and smale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, deare niece, why be ye so pale?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trowe certes that our goode man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath you so laboured, since this night began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you were need to reste hastily.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he laugh’d full merrily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his owen thought he wax’d all red.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This faire wife gan for to shake her head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide thus; “Yea, God wot all” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, cousin mine, it stands not so with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by that God, that gave me soul and life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the realm of France is there no wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lesse lust hath to that sorry play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I may sing alas and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I was born; but to no wight,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dare I not tell how that it stands with me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I think out of this land to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles of myself to make an end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So full am I of dread and eke of care.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This monk began upon this wife to stare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “Alas! my niece, God forbid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye for any sorrow, or any dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fordo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> yourself: but telle me your grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paraventure I may, in your mischief,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Counsel or help; and therefore telle me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All your annoy, for it shall be secre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For on my portos<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> here I make an oath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never in my life, for lief nor loth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne shall I of no counsel you bewray.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The same again to you,” quoth she, “I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God and by this portos I you swear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though men me woulden all in pieces tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne shall I never, for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> to go to hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bewray one word of thing that ye me tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no cousinage, nor alliance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But verily for love and affiance.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they sworn, and thereupon they kiss’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them told other what them list.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Cousin,” quoth she, “if that I hadde space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have none, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> in this place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would I tell a legend of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I have suffer’d since I was a wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mine husband, all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> be he your cousin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth this monk, “by God and Saint Martin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is no more cousin unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is the leaf that hangeth on the tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I call him so, by Saint Denis of France,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the more cause of acquaintance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of you, which I have loved specially</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboven alle women sickerly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This swear I you on my professioun;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me your grief, lest that he come adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hasten you, and go away anon.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My deare love,” quoth she, “O my Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full lief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> were me this counsel for to hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But out it must, I may no more abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My husband is to me the worste man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever was since that the world began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I am a wife, it sits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> not me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To telle no wight of our privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither in bed, nor in none other place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God shield<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> I shoulde tell it for his grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife shall not say of her husband</span>

					<span>But all honour, as I can understand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save unto you thus much I telle shall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As help me God, he is nought worth at all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In no degree, the value of a fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet me grieveth most his niggardy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well ye wot, that women naturally</span>

					<span>Desire thinges six, as well as I.</span>

					<span>They woulde that their husbands shoulde be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and wise, and rich, and thereto free,</span>

					<span>And buxom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> to his wife, and fresh in bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, by that ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> Lord that for us bled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his honour myself for to array,</span>

					<span>Than me were done slander or villainy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if mine husband eke might it espy,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This gentle monk answer’d in this mannere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now truely, mine owen lady dear,</span>

					<span>And with that word he caught her by the flanks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her embraced hard, and kissed her oft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go now your way,” quoth he, “all still and soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let us dine as soon as that ye may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by my cylinder ’tis prime of day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go now, and be as true as I shall be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now elles God forbidde, Sir,” quoth she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth she went, as jolly as a pie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade the cookes that they should them hie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that men mighte dine, and that anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to her husband is this wife gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knocked at his contour boldely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Qui est la?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> quoth he. “Peter! it am I,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth she; “What, Sir, how longe all will ye fast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How longe time will ye reckon and cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your summes, and your bookes, and your things?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil have part of all such reckonings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have enough, pardie, of Godde’s sond.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come down to-day, and let your bagges stond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne be ye not ashamed, that Dan John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall fasting all this day elenge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> gon?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? let us hear a mass, and go we dine.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Wife,” quoth this man, “little canst thou divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The curious businesse that we have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of us chapmen, all so God me save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by that lord that cleped is Saint Ive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scarcely amonges twenty, ten shall thrive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Continually, lasting unto our age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We may well make cheer and good visage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drive forth the world as it may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keepen our estate in privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till we be dead, or elles that we play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pilgrimage, or go out of the way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore have I great necessity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this quaint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> world to advise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For evermore must we stand in dread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of hap and fortune in our chapmanhead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Flanders will I go to-morrow at day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And come again as soon as e’er I may:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, my deare wife, I thee beseek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be to every wight buxom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> and meek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to keep our good be curious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And honestly governe well our house.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast enough, in every manner wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to a thrifty household may suffice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee lacketh none array, nor no vitail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silver in thy purse thou shalt not fail.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And with that word his contour door he shet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down he went; no longer would he let;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily a mass was there said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speedily the tables were laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the dinner faste they them sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And richely this monk the chapman fed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after dinner Dan John soberly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This chapman took apart, and privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said him thus: “Cousin, it standeth so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, well I see, to Bruges ye will go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God and Saint Austin speede you and guide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you, cousin, wisely that ye ride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Governe you also of your diet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attemperly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> in this heat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt us two needeth no strange fare;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farewell, cousin, God shielde you from care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any thing there be, by day or night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it lie in my power and my might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye me will command in any wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It shall be done, right as ye will devise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one thing ere ye go, if it may be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I woulde pray you for to lend to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred frankes, for a week or twy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certain beastes that I muste buy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To store with<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> a place that is ours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(God help me so, I would that it were yours);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall not faile surely of my day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for a thousand francs, a mile way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let this thing be secret, I you pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet to-night these beastes must I buy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fare now well, mine owen cousin dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Grand mercy</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> of your cost and of your cheer.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This noble merchant gentilly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer’d and said, “O cousin mine, Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now sickerly this is a small request:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My gold is youres, when that it you lest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not only my gold, but my chaffare;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take what you list, God shielde that ye spare.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one thing is, ye know it well enow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of chapmen, that their money is their plough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We may creance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> while we have a name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But goldless for to be it is no game.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pay it again when it lies in your ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After my might full fain would I you please.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These hundred frankes set he forth anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he took them to Dan John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No wight in all this world wist of this loan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saving the merchant and Dan John alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They drink, and speak, and roam a while, and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that Dan John rode unto his abbay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The morrow came, and forth this merchant rideth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Flanders-ward, his prentice well him guideth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he came unto Bruges merrily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now went this merchant fast and busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his need, and buyed and creanced;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He neither played at the dice, nor danced;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as a merchant, shortly for to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He led his life; and there I let him dwell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Sunday next<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> the merchant was y-gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Saint Denis y-comen is Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crown and beard all fresh and newly shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the house was not so little a knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor no wight elles that was not full fain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that my lord Dan John was come again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shortly to the point right for to gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The faire wife accorded with Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for these hundred francs he should all night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have her in his armes bolt upright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this accord performed was in deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mirth all night a busy life they lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it was day, that Dan John went his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade the meinie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> “Farewell; have good day.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For none of them, nor no wight in the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had of Dan John right no suspicioun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he rode home to his abbay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or where him list; no more of him I say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The merchant, when that ended was the fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Saint Denis he gan for to repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his wife he made feast and cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tolde her that chaffare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> was so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That needes must he make a chevisance;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was bound in a recognisance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To paye twenty thousand shields<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which this merchant is to Paris gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To borrow of certain friendes that he had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A certain francs, and some with him he lad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he was come into the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For great cherte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> and great affectioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto Dan John he wente first to play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for to borrow of him no money,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bat for to weet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> and see of his welfare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to telle him of his chaffare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As friendes do, when they be met in fere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John him made feast and merry cheer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he him told again full specially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he had well y-bought and graciously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Thanked be God) all whole his merchandise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that he must, in alle manner wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maken a chevisance, as for his best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then he shoulde be in joy and rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John answered, “Certes, I am fain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye in health be come borne again:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that I were rich, as have I bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of twenty thousand shields should ye not miss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ye so kindely the other day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lente me gold, and as I can and may</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thanke you, by God and by Saint Jame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless I took unto our Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your wife at home, the same gold again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon your bench; she wot it well, certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By certain tokens that I can her tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, by your leave, I may no longer dwell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our abbot will out of this town anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his company I muste gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greet well our Dame, mine owen niece sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And farewell, deare cousin, till we meet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This merchant, which that was full ware and wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creanced hath, and paid eke in Paris</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To certain Lombards ready in their hond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sum of gold, and got of them his bond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And home he went, merry as a popinjay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well he knew he stood in such array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That needes must he win in that voyage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand francs, above all his costage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife full ready met him at the gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she was wont of old usage algate;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that night in mirthe they beset;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was rich, and clearly out of debt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it was day, the merchant gan embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife all new, and kiss’d her in her face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up he went, and maked it full tough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No more,” quoth she, “by God ye have enough;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wantonly again with him she play’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at the last this merchant to her said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God,” quoth he, “I am a little wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With you, my wife, although it be me loth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wot ye why? by God, as that I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye have made a manner strangeness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixte me and my cousin, Dan John.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye should have warned me, ere I had gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he you had a hundred frankes paid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By ready token; he had him evil apaid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that I to him spake of chevisance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(He seemed so as by his countenance);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, by God of heaven king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thoughte not to ask of him no thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray thee, wife, do thou no more so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me alway, ere that I from thee go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any debtor hath in mine absence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-payed thee, lest through thy negligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I might him ask a thing that he hath paid.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This wife was not afeared nor afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But boldely she said, and that anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mary! I defy that false monk Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> not of his tokens never a deal:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took me certain gold, I wot it well.⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? evil thedom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> on his monke’s snout!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God it wot, I ween’d withoute doubt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he had given it me, because of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do therewith mine honour and my prow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For cousinage, and eke for <i>belle</i> cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he hath had full often here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I see I stand in such disjoint,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will answer you shortly to the point.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have more slacke debtors than am I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will pay you well and readily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day, and if so be I fail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am your wife, score it upon my tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I shall pay as soon as ever I may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, by my troth, I have on mine array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not in waste, bestow’d it every deal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for I have bestowed it so well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For your honour, for Godde’s sake I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be not wroth, but let us laugh and play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall my jolly body have to wed;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I will not pay you but in bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive it me, mine owen spouse dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn hitherward, and make better cheer.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The merchant saw none other remedy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to chide, it were but a folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that the thing might not amended be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, wife,” he said, “and I forgive it thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by thy life be no more so large;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep better my good, this give I thee in charge.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus endeth now my tale; and God us send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taling enough, until our lives’ end!</span>
