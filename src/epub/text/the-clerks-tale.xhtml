					<span>“Sir Clerk of Oxenford,” our Hoste said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were new spoused, sitting at the board:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This day I heard not of your tongue a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow ye study about some sophime:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Solomon saith, every thing hath time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s sake, be of better cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no time for to study here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us some merry tale, by your fay;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what man that is entered in a play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He needes must unto that play assent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But preache not, as friars do in Lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make us for our olde sinnes weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor that thy tale make us not to sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us some merry thing of aventures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your terms, your coloures, and your figures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep them in store, till so be ye indite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High style, as when that men to kinges write.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speake so plain at this time, I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may understande what ye say.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This worthy Clerk benignely answer’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hoste,” quoth he, “I am under your yerd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have of us as now the governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore would I do you obeisance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As far as reason asketh, hardily:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you tell a tale, which that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Learn’d at Padova of a worthy clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As proved by his wordes and his werk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is now dead, and nailed in his chest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God to give his soul good rest.</span>

					<span>Highte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Illumin’d all Itale of poetry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Linian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> did of philosophy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or law, or other art particulere:</span>

					<span>But death, that will not suffer us dwell here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as it were a twinkling of an eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them both hath slain, and alle we shall die.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“But forth to tellen of this worthy man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That taughte me this tale, as I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say that first he with high style inditeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Ere he the body of his tale writeth)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A proem, in the which describeth he</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That be the bounds of all West Lombardy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of Mount Vesulus in special,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as the Po out of a welle small</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taketh his firste springing and his source,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That eastward aye increaseth in his course</span>

					<span>T’Emilia-ward,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> to Ferraro, and Venice,</span>

					<span>The which a long thing were to devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truely, as to my judgement,</span>

					<span>Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>

						<span>There is, right at the west side of Itale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down at the root of Vesulus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> the cold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lusty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> plain, abundant of vitaille;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There many a town and tow’r thou may’st behold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That founded were in time of fathers old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many another delectable sight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Saluces this noble country hight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A marquis whilom lord was of that land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As were his worthy elders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> him before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And obedient, aye ready to his hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were all his lieges, bothe less and more:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus in delight he liv’d, and had done yore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Belov’d and drad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> through favour of fortune,</span>

						<span>Both of his lordes and of his commune.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Therewith he was, to speak of lineage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gentilest y-born of Lombardy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fair person, and strong, and young of age,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And full of honour and of courtesy:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discreet enough his country for to gie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saving in some things that he was to blame;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Walter was this younge lordes name.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I blame him thus, that he consider’d not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In time coming what might him betide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But on his present lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> was all his thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for to hawk and hunt on every side;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well nigh all other cares let he slide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke he would (that was the worst of all)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wedde no wife for aught that might befall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Only that point his people bare so sore,</span>

						<span>That flockmel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> on a day to him they went,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>(Or elles that the lord would best assent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he should tell him what the people meant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or elles could he well shew such mattere),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He to the marquis said as ye shall hear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“O noble Marquis! your humanity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assureth us and gives us hardiness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As oft as time is of necessity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That we to you may tell our heaviness:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accepte, Lord, now of your gentleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What we with piteous heart unto you plain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And let your ears my voice not disdain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> have I nought to do in this mattere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More than another man hath in this place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet forasmuch as ye, my Lord so dear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have always shewed me favour and grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dare the better ask of you a space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of audience, to shewen our request,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ye, my Lord, to do right as you lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>

						<span>And all your work, and ev’r have done, that we</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ne coulde not ourselves devise how</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We mighte live in more felicity:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save one thing, Lord, if that your will it be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That for to be a wedded man you lest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then were your people in sovereign hearte’s rest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Bowe your neck under the blissful yoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sovereignty, and not of service,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which that men call espousal or wedlock:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thinke, Lord, among your thoughtes wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that our dayes pass in sundry wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though we sleep, or wake, or roam, or ride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye fleeth time, it will no man abide.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“And though your greene youthe flow’r as yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In creepeth age always as still as stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And death menaceth every age, and smit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In each estate, for there escapeth none:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all so certain as we know each one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That we shall die, as uncertain we all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be of that day when death shall on us fall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Accepte then of us the true intent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never yet refused youre hest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we will, Lord, if that ye will assent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Choose you a wife, in short time at the lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Born of the gentilest and of the best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all this land, so that it ought to seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Honour to God and you, as we can deem.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Deliver us out of all this busy dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And take a wife, for highe Godde’s sake:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if it so befell, as God forbid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That through your death your lineage should slake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that a strange successor shoulde take</span>

						<span>Your heritage, oh! woe were us on live:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore we pray you hastily to wive.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Their meeke prayer and their piteous cheer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made the marquis for to have pity.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Ye will,” quoth he, “mine owen people dear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that I ne’er ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> thought constraine me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I me rejoiced of my liberty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seldom time is found in rnarriage;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where I was free, I must be in servage!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“But natheless I see your true intent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trust upon your wit, and have done aye:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore of my free will I will assent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wedde me, as soon as e’er I may.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But whereas ye have proffer’d me to-day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To choose me a wife, I you release</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That choice, and pray you of that proffer cease.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“For God it wot, that children often been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unlike their worthy elders them before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bounte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> comes all of God, not of the strene<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which they be engender’d and y-bore:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I trust in Godde’s bounte, and therefore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My marriage, and mine estate and rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I him betake;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> he may do as him lest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Let me alone in choosing of my wife;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That charge upon my back I will endure:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I you pray, and charge upon your life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That what wife that I take, ye me assure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To worship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> her, while that her life may dure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In word and work both here and elleswhere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As she an emperore’s daughter were.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“And farthermore this shall ye swear, that ye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against my choice shall never grudge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> nor strive.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For since I shall forego my liberty</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At your request, as ever may I thrive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where as mine heart is set, there will I live</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> ye will assent in such mannere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I pray you speak no more of this mattere.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With heartly will they sworen and assent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all this thing, there said not one wight nay:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beseeching him of grace, ere that they went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he would grante them a certain day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his espousal, soon as e’er he rnay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For yet always the people somewhat dread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest that the marquis woulde no wife wed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He granted them a day, such as him lest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On which he would be wedded sickerly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said he did all this at their request;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they with humble heart full buxomly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him thanked all; and thus they have an end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their intent, and home again they wend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And hereupon he to his officers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Commanded for the feaste to purvey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to his privy knightes and squiers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such charge he gave, as him list on them lay:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they to his commandement obey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each of them doth all his diligence</span>

						<span>He not with wanton looking of folly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eyen cast on her, but in sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> wise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> he would him oft advise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>And eke her virtue, passing any wight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of so young age, as well in cheer as deed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though the people have no great insight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In virtue, he considered full right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her bounte,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and disposed that he would</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wed only her, if ever wed he should.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The day of wedding came, but no wight can</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Telle what woman that it shoulde be;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which marvail wonder’d many a man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saide, when they were in privity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will he not wed? Alas, alas the while!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why will he thus himself and us beguile?”</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Of gemmes, set in gold and in azure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brooches and ringes, for Griselda’s sake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of her clothing took he the measure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a maiden like unto her stature,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke of other ornamentes all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That unto such a wedding shoulde fall.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>

					<p>
						<span>The time of undern<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> of the same day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Approached, that this wedding shoulde be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the palace put was in array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both hall and chamber, each in its degree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Houses of office stuffed with plenty</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There may’st thou see of dainteous vitaille,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That may be found, as far as lasts Itale.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This royal marquis, richely array’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lordes and ladies in his company,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The which unto the feaste were pray’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of his retinue the bach’lery,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many a sound of sundry melody,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the village, of the which I told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this array the right way did they hold.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Griseld’ of this (God wot) full innocent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That for her shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> was all this array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fetche water at a well is went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And home she came as soon as e’er she may.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For well she had heard say, that on that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marquis shoulde wed, and, if she might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She fain would have seen somewhat of that sight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>She thought, “I will with other maidens stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That be my fellows, in our door, and see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marchioness; and therefore will I fand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do at home, as soon as it may be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The labour which belongeth unto me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then I may at leisure her behold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If she this way unto the castle hold.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And as she would over the threshold gon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marquis came and gan for her to call,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And she set down her water-pot anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the threshold, in an ox’s stall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And down upon her knees she gan to fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> countenance kneeled still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till she had heard what was the lorde’s will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The thoughtful marquis spake unto the maid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full soberly, and said in this mannere:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Where is your father, Griseldis?” he said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And she with reverence, in humble cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Answered, “Lord, he is all ready here.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in she went withoute longer let,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the marquis she her father fet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He by the hand then took the poore man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saide thus, when he him had aside:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Janicola, I neither may nor can</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Longer the pleasance of mine hearte hide;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that thou vouchesafe, whatso betide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy daughter will I take, ere that I wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As for my wife, unto her life’s end.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Thou lovest me, that know I well certain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And art my faithful liegeman y-bore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>It liketh thee; and specially therefore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tell me that point, that I have said before⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that thou wilt unto this purpose draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To take me as for thy son-in-law.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This sudden case<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> the man astonied so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That red he wax’d, abash’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> and all quaking</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stood; unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> said he wordes mo’,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But only thus; “Lord,” quoth he, “my willing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is as ye will, nor against your liking</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will no thing, mine owen lord so dear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as you list governe this mattere.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Then will I,” quoth the marquis softely,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“That in thy chamber I, and thou, and she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have a collation;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> and know’st thou why?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For I will ask her, if her will it be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be my wife, and rule her after me:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all this shall be done in thy presence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not speak out of thine audience.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And in the chamber while they were about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The treaty, which ye shall hereafter hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people came into the house without,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wonder’d them in how honest mannere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tenderly she kept her father dear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But utterly Griseldis wonder might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For never erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> ne saw she such a sight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No wonder is though that she be astoned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see so great a guest come in that place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She never was to no such guestes woned;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which she looked with full pale face.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But shortly forth this matter for to chase,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>These are the wordes that the marquis said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To this benigne, very,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> faithful maid.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Griseld’,” he said, “ye shall well understand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It liketh to your father and to me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I you wed, and eke it may so stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I suppose ye will that it so be:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But these demandes ask I first,” quoth he,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Since that it shall be done in hasty wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will ye assent, or elles you advise?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“I say this, be ye ready with good heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all my lust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and that I freely may,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As me best thinketh, do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> you laugh or smart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never ye to grudge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> night nor day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke when I say Yea, ye say not Nay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neither by word, nor frowning countenance?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swear this, and here I swear our alliance.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Wond’ring upon this word, quaking for dread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She saide; “Lord, indigne and unworthy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Am I to this honour that ye me bede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as ye will yourself, right so will I:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And here I swear, that never willingly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In word or thought I will you disobey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For to be dead; though me were loth to dey.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“This is enough, Griselda mine,” quoth he.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth he went with a full sober cheer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out at the door, and after then came she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the people he said in this mannere:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“This is my wife,” quoth he, “that standeth here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Honoure her, and love her, I you pray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whoso me loves; there is no more to say.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And, for that nothing of her olde gear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She shoulde bring into his house, he bade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That women should despoile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> her right there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which these ladies were nothing glad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To handle her clothes wherein she was clad:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless this maiden bright of hue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From foot to head they clothed have all new.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Her haires have they comb’d that lay untress’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full rudely, and with their fingers small</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crown upon her head they have dress’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And set her full of nouches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> great and small:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of her array why should I make a tale?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unneth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> the people her knew for her fairness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When she transmuted was in such richess.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The marquis hath her spoused with a ring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought for the same cause, and then her set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a horse snow-white, and well ambling,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to his palace, ere he longer let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>

						<span>Conveyed her; and thus the day they spend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In revel, till the sunne gan descend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And, shortly forth this tale for to chase,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I say, that to this newe marchioness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God hath such favour sent her of his grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it ne seemed not by likeliness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she was born and fed in rudeness⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in a cot, or in an ox’s stall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But nourish’d in an emperore’s hall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To every wight she waxen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> is so dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And worshipful, that folk where she was born,</span>

						<span>That to Janicol’ of whom I spake before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She was not daughter, for by conjecture</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them thought she was another creature.</span>

					<p>
						<span>For though that ever virtuous was she,</span>

						<span>She was increased in such excellence</span>

						<span>Of thewes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> good, y-set in high bounte,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>When she had heard all this, she not amev’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neither in word, in cheer, nor countenance</span>

						<span>She saide; “Lord, all lies in your pleasance,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Glad was the marquis for her answering,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But yet he feigned as he were not so;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All dreary was his cheer and his looking</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that he should out of the chamber go.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon after this, a furlong way or two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He privily hath told all his intent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto a man, and to his wife him sent.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A manner sergeant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> was this private man,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The which he faithful often founden had</span>

						<span>In thinges great, and eke such folk well can</span>

						<span>Do execution in thinges bad:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lord knew well, that he him loved and drad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when this sergeant knew his lorde’s will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the chamber stalked he full still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Madam,” he said, “ye must forgive it me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though I do thing to which I am constrain’d;</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And so will I, there is no more to say.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“This child I am commanded for to take.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spake no more, but out the child he hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dispiteously,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> and gan a cheer to make<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though he would have slain it ere he went.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Griseldis must all suffer and consent:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as a lamb she sat there meek and still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And let this cruel sergeant do his will</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Suspect his face, suspect his word also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suspect the time in which he this began:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alas! her daughter, that she loved so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She weened<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> he would have it slain right tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless she neither wept nor siked,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conforming her to what the marquis liked.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But at the last to speake she began,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And meekly she unto the sergeant pray’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So as he was a worthy gentle man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she might kiss her child, ere that it died:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in her barme<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> this little child she laid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With full sad face, and gan the child to bless,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lulled it, and after gan it kiss.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And thus she said in her benigne voice:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farewell, my child, I shall thee never see;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But since I have thee marked with the cross,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that father y-blessed may’st thou be</span>

						<span>That for us died upon a cross of tree:</span>

					<p>
						<span>I trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> that to a norice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> in this case</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It had been hard this ruthe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> for to see:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well might a mother then have cried, “Alas!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless so sad steadfast was she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she endured all adversity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the sergeant meekely she said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Have here again your little younge maid.</span>

					<p>
						<span>“Go now,” quoth she, “and do my lord’s behest.</span>

						<span>But took the child and went upon his way.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sergeant came unto his lord again,</span>

						<span>He told him point for point, in short and plain,</span>

						<span>The sergeant went, and hath fulfill’d this thing.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>That perfectly her children loved she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would have ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> that of some subtilty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of malice, or for cruel corage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>She hadde suffer’d this with sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> visage.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But well he knew, that, next himself, certain</span>

						<span>She lov’d her children best in every wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now of women would I aske fain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If these assayes mighte not suffice?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What could a sturdy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> husband more devise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To prove her wifehood and her steadfastness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he continuing ev’r in sturdiness?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But there be folk of such condition,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, when they have a certain purpose take,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thiey cannot stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of their intention,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, right as they were bound unto a stake,</span>

						<span>They will not of their firste purpose slake:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>

						<span>Right so this marquis fully hath purpos’d</span>

						<span>To tempt his wife, as he was first dispos’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He waited, if by word or countenance</span>

						<span>That she to him was changed of corage:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>

						<span>For which it seemed thus, that of them two</span>

						<span>The same pleasance was her lust also;</span>

						<span>The sland’r of Walter wondrous wide sprad,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Had murder’d both his children privily:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such murmur was among them commonly.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No wonder is: for to the people’s ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came no word, but that they murder’d were.</span>
					</p>

						<br/>
						<span>Made them that they him hated therefore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be a murd’rer is a hateful name.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless, for earnest or for game,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He of his cruel purpose would not stent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>

						<span>When that his daughter twelve year was of age,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For, out of doubt, this olde poore man</span>

						<span>(For he by noise of folk knew her coming),</span>

						<span>And with her olde coat, as it might be,</span>

					<p>
						<span>Thus had this piteous day a blissful end;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For every man and woman did his might</span>

					<p>
						<span>Full many a year in high prosperity</span>

					<p>
						<span>This story is said,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> not for that wives should</span>
