				<p>
					<span>When ended was my tale of Melibee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of Prudence and her benignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Hoste said, “As I am faithful man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the precious <i>corpus Madrian</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> than a barrel of ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That goode lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> my wife had heard this tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she is no thing of such patience</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was this Meliboeus’ wife Prudence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Godde’s bones! when I beat my knaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She bringeth me the greate clubbed staves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crieth, ‘Slay the dogges every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And break of them both back and ev’ry bone.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that any neighebour of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will not in church unto my wife incline,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or be so hardy to her to trespace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she comes home she rampeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> in my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crieth, ‘False coward, wreak<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> thy wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By <i>corpus Domini</i>, I will have thy knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt have my distaff, and go spin.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day till night right thus she will begin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Alas!’ she saith, ‘that ever I was shape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wed a milksop, or a coward ape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That will be overlad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> with every wight!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou darest not stand by thy wife’s right.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This is my life, but if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> that I will fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out at door anon I must me dight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles I am lost, but if that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be, like a wilde lion, fool-hardy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well she will do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> me slay some day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some neighebour and thenne go my way;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am perilous with knife in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that I dare not her withstand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she is big in armes, by my faith!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall he find, that her misdoth or saith.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let us pass away from this mattere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord the Monk,” quoth he, “be merry of cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ye shall tell a tale truely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Rochester stands here faste by.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ride forth, mine owen lord, break not our game.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by my troth I cannot tell your name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether shall I call you my lord Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Dan Thomas, or elles Dan Albon?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what house be ye, by your father’s kin?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I vow to God, thou hast a full fair skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is a gentle pasture where thou go’st;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art not like a penant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> or a ghost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my faith thou art some officer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some worthy sexton, or some cellarer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by my father’s soul, as to my dome,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art a master when thou art at home;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No poore cloisterer, nor no novice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But a governor, both wily and wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal, of brawnes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> and of bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A right well-faring person for the nonce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God give him confusion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That first thee brought into religion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou would’st have been a treade-fowl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> aright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hadst thou as greate leave, as thou hast might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To perform all thy lust in engendrure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hadst begotten many a creature.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! why wearest thou so wide a cope?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>God give me sorrow, but, an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> I were pope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only thou, but every mighty man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he were shorn full high upon his pan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should have a wife; for all this world is lorn;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Religion hath ta’en up all the corn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of treading, and we borel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> men be shrimps:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of feeble trees there come wretched imps.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This maketh that our heires be so slender</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And feeble, that they may not well engender.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This maketh that our wives will assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Religious folk, for they may better pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Venus’ payementes than may we:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God wot, no lusheburghes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> paye ye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But be not wroth, my lord, though that I play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft in game a sooth have I heard say.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This worthy Monk took all in patience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “I will do all my diligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As far as souneth unto honesty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To telle you a tale, or two or three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if you list to hearken hitherward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you say the life of Saint Edward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles first tragedies I will tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which I have an hundred in my cell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tragedy is to say<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> a certain story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As olde bookes maken us memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of him that stood in great prosperity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is y-fallen out of high degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In misery, and endeth wretchedly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they be versified commonly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of six feet, which men call hexametron;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In prose eke be indited many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke in metre, in many a sundry wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, this declaring ought enough suffice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now hearken, if ye like for to hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first I you beseech in this mattere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I by order telle not these things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be it of popes, emperors, or kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After their ages,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> as men written find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell them some before and some behind,</span>

					<span>As it now cometh to my remembrance,</span>

					<span>Have me excused of mine ignorance.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>I will bewail, in manner of tragedy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The harm of them that stood in high degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And felle so, that there was no remedy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bring them out of their adversity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, certain, when that Fortune list to flee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There may no man the course of her wheel hold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let no man trust in blind prosperity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware by these examples true and old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At <b>Lucifer</b>, though he an angel were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not a man, at him I will begin.</span>

					<span>For though Fortune may no angel dere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>From high degree yet fell he for his sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down into hell, where as he yet is in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Lucifer! brightest of angels all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now art thou Satanas, that may’st not twin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the misery in which thou art fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo <b>Adam</b>, in the field of Damascene<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Godde’s owen finger wrought was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not begotten of man’s sperm unclean;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And welt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> all Paradise saving one tree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had never worldly man so high degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Adam, till he for misgovernance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was driven out of his prosperity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To labour, and to hell, and to mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo <b>Sampson</b>, which that was annunciate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the angel, long ere his nativity;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was to God Almighty consecrate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stood in nobless while that he might see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never such another as was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak of strength, and thereto hardiness;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to his wives told he his secre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through which he slew himself for wretchedness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sampson, this noble and mighty champion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute weapon, save his handes tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He slew and all to-rente<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> the lion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward his wedding walking by the way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His false wife could him so please, and pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she his counsel knew; and she, untrue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his foes his counsel gan bewray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him forsook, and took another new.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Three hundred foxes Sampson took for ire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all their tailes he together band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set the foxes’ tailes all on fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he in every tail had knit a brand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they burnt all the combs of that lend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all their oliveres<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and vines eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand men he slew eke with his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had no weapon but an ass’s cheek.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When they were slain, so thirsted him, that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was well-nigh lorn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> for which he gan to pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That God would on his pain have some pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And send him drink, or elles must he die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of this ass’s check, that was so dry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of a wang-tooth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> sprang anon a well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which, he drank enough, shortly to say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus help’d him God, as <i>Judicum</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> can tell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By very force, at Gaza, on a night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maugre the Philistines of that city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gates of the town he hath up plight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his back y-carried them hath he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High on an hill, where as men might them see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O noble mighty Sampson, lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hadst thou not told to women thy secre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all this world there had not been thy peer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Sampson never cider drank nor wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor on his head came razor none nor shear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By precept of the messenger divine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all his strengthes in his haires were;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fully twenty winters, year by year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had of Israel the governance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soone shall he weepe many a tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For women shall him bringe to mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unto his leman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> Dalila<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> he told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his haires all his strengthe lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And falsely to his foemen she him sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sleeping in her barme<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> upon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She made to clip or shear his hair away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made his foemen all his craft espien.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they founde him in this array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They bound him fast, and put out both his eyen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, ere his hair was clipped or y-shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no bond with which men might him bind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now is he in prison in a cave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as they made him at the querne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> grind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O noble Sampson, strongest of mankind!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O whilom judge in glory and richess!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may’st thou weepe with thine eyen blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since thou from weal art fall’n to wretchedness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Th’end of this caitiff<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> was as I shall say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His foemen made a feast upon a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made him as their fool before them play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was in a temple of great array.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last he made a foul affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he two pillars shook, and made them fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down fell temple and all, and there it lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And slew himself and eke his foemen all;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This is to say, the princes every one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke three thousand bodies were there slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With falling of the great temple of stone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Sampson now will I no more sayn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware by this example old and plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no man tell his counsel to his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such thing as he would have secret fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that it touch his limbes or his life.</span>

					<span>And made his horse to fret<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> him flesh and bone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He slew the fiery serpent venomous;</span>

					<span>Both East and West, South and Septentrioun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of rubies, sapphires, and of pearles white</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were all his clothes embroider’d up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he in gemmes greatly gan delight.</span>

				<p>
					<span>More delicate, more pompous of array,</span>

					<span>More proud, was never emperor than he;</span>

					<span>That ilke cloth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> that he had worn one day,</span>

					<span>His lustes were as law, in his degree,</span>

					<span>For Fortune as his friend would him obey.</span>

				<p>
					<span>He Rome burnt for his delicacy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The senators he slew upon a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To heare how that men would weep and cry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And slew his brother, and by his sister lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mother made he in piteous array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he her wombe slitte, to behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he conceived was; so well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he so little of his mother told.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No tear out of his eyen for that sight</span>

					<span>Be doomesman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> of her deade beauty:</span>

					<span>He made him so conning and so souple,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That longe time it was ere tyranny,</span>

					<span>This Seneca, of which that I devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because Nero had of him suche dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he from vices would him aye chastise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Discreetly, as by word, and not by deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” he would say, “an emperor must need</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be virtuous, and hate tyranny.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he made him in a bath to bleed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On both his armes, till he muste die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Nero had eke of a custumance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Which afterward he thought a great grievance;</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now fell it so, that Fortune list no longer</span>

				<p>
					<span>The people rose upon him on a night,</span>

					<span>How that to these great conquerores two</span>

					<span>Fortune was first a friend, and since<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> a foe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No manne trust upon her favour long,</span>

				<p>
					<span>The riche <b>Croesus</b>, whilom king of Lyde⁠—</span>

					<span>Of which Croesus Cyrus him sore drad⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet was he caught amiddes all his pride,</span>

					<span>And to be burnt men to the fire him lad;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>

					<span>But such a rain down from the welkin shad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That slew the fire, and made him to escape:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to beware no grace yet he had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till fortune on the gallows made him gape.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When he escaped was, he could not stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>

					<span>For to begin a newe war again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He weened well, for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> that Fortune him sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such hap, that he escaped through the rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his foes he mighte not be slain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke a sweven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> on a night he mette,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>

					<span>Of which he was so proud, and eke so fain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he in vengeance all his hearte set.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Upon a tree he was set, as he thought,</span>

					<span>Where Jupiter him wash’d, both back and side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Phoebus eke a fair towel him brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dry him with; and therefore wax’d his pride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his daughter that stood him beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he knew in high science to abound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bade her tell him what it signified;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she his dream began right thus expound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The tree,” quoth she, “the gallows is to mean,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Thou shalt y-hangeth be, father, certain;</span>

					<span>Tragedy is none other manner thing,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There may no tongue telle for pity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But little out of Pisa stands a tow’r,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In whiche tow’r in prison put was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aud with him be his little children three;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The eldest scarcely five years was of age;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! Fortune, it was great cruelty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such birdes for to put in such a cage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Damned was he to die in that prison;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Roger, which that bishop was of Pise,</span>

					<span>Had on him made a false suggestion,</span>

					<span>Through which the people gan upon him rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And put him in prison, in such a wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have heard; and meat and drink he had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So small, that well unneth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> it might suffice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal it was full poor and bad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And on a day befell, that in that hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that his meate wont was to be brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The jailor shut the doores of the tow’r;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He heard it right well, but he spake nought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his heart anon there fell a thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they for hunger woulde do him dien;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Therewith the teares fell from his eyen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His youngest son, that three years was of age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto him said, “Father, why do ye weep?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When will the jailor bringen our pottage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there no morsel bread that ye do keep?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am so hungry, that I may not sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now woulde God that I might sleepen ever!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For woe his armes two he gan to bite,</span>

					<span>And said, “Alas! Fortune, and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thy false wheel my woe all may I wite.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>

					<span>Our flesh thou gave us, our flesh take us fro’,</span>
