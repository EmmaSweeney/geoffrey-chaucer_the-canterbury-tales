			<p>
				<span>WHILOM,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> as olde stories tellen us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was a duke that highte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> Theseus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Athens he was lord and governor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his time such a conqueror</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That greater was there none under the sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a riche country had he won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What with his wisdom and his chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He conquer’d all the regne of Feminie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whilom was y-cleped Scythia;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weddede the Queen Hippolyta</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought her home with him to his country</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With muchel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> glory and great solemnity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke her younge sister Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus with vict’ry and with melody</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let I this worthy Duke to Athens ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his host, in armes him beside.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And certes, if it n’ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> too long to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would have told you fully the mannere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How wonnen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> was the regne of Feminie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Theseus, and by his chivalry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the greate battle for the nonce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt Athenes and the Amazons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how assieged was Hippolyta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faire hardy queen of Scythia;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the feast that was at her wedding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the tempest at her homecoming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all these things I must as now forbear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have, God wot, a large field to ear;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weake be the oxen in my plough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The remnant of my tale is long enow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not letten eke none of this rout.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let every fellow tell his tale about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let see now who shall the supper win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as I left,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> I will again begin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This Duke, of whom I make mentioun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he was come almost unto the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all his weal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> and in his moste pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was ware, as he cast his eye aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where that there kneeled in the highe way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A company of ladies, tway and tway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each after other, clad in clothes black:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But such a cry and such a woe they make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in this world n’is creature living,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hearde such another waimenting.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of this crying would they never stenten,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they the reines of his bridle henten.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What folk be ye that at mine homecoming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perturben so my feaste with crying?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth Theseus; “Have ye so great envy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of mine honour, that thus complain and cry?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or who hath you misboden,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> or offended?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do telle me, if it may be amended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And why that ye be clad thus all in black?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The oldest lady of them all then spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she had swooned, with a deadly cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it was ruthe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> for to see or hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She saide; “Lord, to whom fortune hath given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vict’ry, and as a conqueror to liven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nought grieveth us your glory and your honour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we beseechen mercy and succour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have mercy on our woe and our distress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some drop of pity, through thy gentleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon us wretched women let now fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For certes, lord, there is none of us all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hath not been a duchess or a queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now be we caitives,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> as it is well seen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thanked be Fortune, and her false wheel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That none estate ensureth to be wele.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And certes, lord, t’abiden your presence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in this temple of the goddess Clemence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have been waiting all this fortenight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now help us, lord, since it lies in thy might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I, wretched wight, that weep and waile thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was whilom wife to king Capaneus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That starf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> at Thebes, cursed be that day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And alle we that be in this array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maken all this lamentatioun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We losten all our husbands at that town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While that the siege thereabouten lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet the olde Creon, wellaway!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lord is now of Thebes the city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfilled of ire and of iniquity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He for despite, and for his tyranny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do the deade bodies villainy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all our lorde’s, which that been y-slaw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath all the bodies on an heap y-draw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will not suffer them by none assent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither to be y-buried, nor y-brent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But maketh houndes eat them in despite.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that word, withoute more respite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fallen groff,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> and cryden piteously;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have on us wretched women some mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let our sorrow sinken in thine heart.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This gentle Duke down from his courser start</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hearte piteous, when he heard them speak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him thoughte that his heart would all to-break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he saw them so piteous and so mate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whilom weren of so great estate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his armes he them all up hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And them comforted in full good intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swore his oath, as he was true knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He woulde do so farforthly his might<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the tyrant Creon them to wreak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the people of Greece shoulde speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How Creon was of Theseus y-served,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he that had his death full well deserved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And right anon withoute more abode<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>His banner he display’d, and forth he rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Thebes-ward, and all his, host beside:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No ner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> Athenes would he go nor ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor take his ease fully half a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But onward on his way that night he lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sent anon Hippolyta the queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Emily her younge sister sheen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the town of Athens for to dwell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth he rit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> there is no more to tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The red statue of Mars with spear and targe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So shineth in his white banner large</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the fieldes glitter up and down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by his banner borne is his pennon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gold full rich, in which there was y-beat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Minotaur<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> which that he slew in Crete</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus rit this Duke, thus rit this conqueror</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his host of chivalry the flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till that he came to Thebes, and alight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair in a field, there as he thought to fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But shortly for to speaken of this thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Creon, which that was of Thebes king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fought, and slew him manly as a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In plain bataille, and put his folk to flight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by assault he won the city after,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rent adown both wall, and spar, and rafter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the ladies he restored again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bodies of their husbands that were slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do obsequies, as was then the guise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But it were all too long for to devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greate clamour, and the waimenting,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that the ladies made at the brenning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the bodies, and the great honour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Theseus the noble conqueror</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did to the ladies, when they from him went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But shortly for to tell is mine intent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that this worthy Duke, this Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Creon slain, and wonnen Thebes thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still in the field he took all night his rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did with all the country as him lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ransack in the tas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> of bodies dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Them for to strip of harness and of weed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pillers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> did their business and cure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the battle and discomfiture.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so befell, that in the tas they found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through girt with many a grievous bloody wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two younge knightes ligging by and by<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both in one armes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> wrought full richely:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whiche two, Arcita hight that one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he that other highte Palamon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not fully quick, nor fully dead they were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But by their coat-armour, and by their gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heralds knew them well in special,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As those that weren of the blood royal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Thebes, and of sistren two y-born.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the tas the pillers have them torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have them carried soft unto the tent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Theseus, and he full soon them sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Athens, for to dwellen in prison</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perpetually, he n’olde no ranson.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when this worthy Duke had thus y-done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He took his host, and home he rit anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laurel crowned as a conquerour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he lived in joy and in honour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Term of his life;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> what needeth wordes mo’?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwellen this Palamon, and eke Arcite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For evermore, there may no gold them quite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus passed year by year, and day by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it fell ones in a morn of May</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Emily, that fairer was to seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than is the lily upon his stalke green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fresher than the May with flowers new</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For with the rose colour strove her hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I n’ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> which was the finer of them two),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere it was day, as she was wont to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was arisen, and all ready dight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For May will have no sluggardy a-night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The season pricketh every gentle heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maketh him out of his sleep to start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saith, “Arise, and do thine observance.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This maketh Emily have remembrance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do honour to May, and for to rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-clothed was she fresh for to devise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her yellow hair was braided in a tress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind her back, a yarde long I guess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the garden at the sun uprist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>She walketh up and down where as her list.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gathereth flowers, party<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> white and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make a sotel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> garland for her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as an angel heavenly she sung.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greate tower, that was so thick and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which of the castle was the chief dungeon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Where as these knightes weren in prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which I tolde you, and telle shall),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was even joinant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> to the garden wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as this Emily had her playing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bright was the sun, and clear that morrowning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Palamon, this woful prisoner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As was his wont, by leave of his gaoler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was ris’n, and roamed in a chamber on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which he all the noble city sigh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke the garden, full of branches green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as this fresh Emelia the sheen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in her walk, and roamed up and down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went in his chamber roaming to and fro,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to himself complaining of his woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he was born, full oft he said, Alas!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so befell, by aventure or cas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That through a window thick of many a bar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of iron great, and square as any spar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cast his eyes upon Emelia,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal he blent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> and cried, Ah!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though he stungen were unto the heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that cry Arcite anon up start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide, “Cousin mine, what aileth thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That art so pale and deadly for to see?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why cried’st thou? who hath thee done offence?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Godde’s love, take all in patience</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our prison,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> for it may none other be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fortune hath giv’n us this adversity’.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some wick’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> aspect or disposition</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Saturn, by some constellation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath giv’n us this, although we had it sworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So stood the heaven when that we were born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We must endure; this is the short and plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This Palamon answer’d, and said again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Cousin, forsooth of this opinion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast a vain imagination.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This prison caused me not for to cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I was hurt right now thorough mine eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into mine heart; that will my bane<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fairness of the lady that I see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yond in the garden roaming to and fro,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is cause of all my crying and my woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I n’ot wher<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> she be woman or goddess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Venus is it, soothly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> as I guess.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal on knees adown he fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide: “Venus, if it be your will</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You in this garden thus to transfigure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before me sorrowful wretched creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of this prison help that we may scape.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if so be our destiny be shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By etern word to dien in prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our lineage have some compassion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is so low y-brought by tyranny.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with that word Arcita gan espy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where as this lady roamed to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if that Palamon was wounded sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a sigh he saide piteously:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The freshe beauty slay’th me suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her that roameth yonder in the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> I have her mercy and her grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may see her at the leaste way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am but dead; there is no more to say.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Palamon, when he these wordes heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispiteously<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> he looked, and answer’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whether say’st thou this in earnest or in play?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay,” quoth Arcite, “in earnest, by my fay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>God help me so, me lust full ill to play.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Palamon gan knit his browes tway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It were,” quoth he, “to thee no great honour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For to be false, nor for to be traitour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me, that am thy cousin and thy brother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-sworn full deep, and each of us to other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never for to dien in the pain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till that the death departen shall us twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither of us in love to hinder other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor in none other case, my leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> brother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that thou shouldest truly farther me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In every case, as I should farther thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was thine oath, and mine also certain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wot it well, thou dar’st it not withsayn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus art thou of my counsel out of doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now thou wouldest falsely be about</span>

				<span>Now certes, false Arcite, thou shalt not so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I lov’d her first, and tolde thee my woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As to my counsel, and my brother sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To farther me, as I have told beforn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which thou art y-bounden as a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To helpe me, if it lie in thy might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or elles art thou false, I dare well sayn,”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This Arcita full proudly spake again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou shalt,” quoth he, “be rather<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> false than I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou art false, I tell thee utterly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For <i>par amour</i> I lov’d her first ere thou.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wilt thou say? thou wist it not right now<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether she be a woman or goddess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine is affection of holiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mine is love, as to a creature:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which I tolde thee mine aventure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As to my cousin, and my brother sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pose,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> that thou loved’st her beforn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> thou not well the olde clerke’s saw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That who shall give a lover any law?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love is a greater lawe, by my pan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than may be giv’n to any earthly man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore positive law, and such decree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is broke alway for love in each degree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man must needes love, maugre his head.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>

				<span>He may not flee it, though he should be dead,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And eke it is not likely all thy life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To standen in her grace, no more than I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well thou wost thyselfe verily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou and I be damned to prison</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perpetual, us gaineth no ranson.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We strive, as did the houndes for the bone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fought all day, and yet their part was none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a kite, while that they were so wroth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bare away the bone betwixt them both.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore at the kinge’s court, my brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each man for himselfe, there is no other.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love if thee list; for I love and aye shall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soothly, leve brother, this is all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in this prison musten we endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each of us take his Aventure.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Great was the strife and long between these tway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If that I hadde leisure for to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to the effect: it happen’d on a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(To tell it you as shortly as I may),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A worthy duke that hight Perithous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fellow was to the Duke Theseus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> day that they were children lite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was come to Athens, his fellow to visite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for to play, as he was wont to do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in this world he loved no man so;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he lov’d him as tenderly again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So well they lov’d, as olde bookes sayn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when that one was dead, soothly to sayn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His fellow went and sought him down in hell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But of that story list me not to write.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Duke Perithous loved well Arcite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had him known at Thebes year by year:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And finally at request and prayere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Perithous, withoute ranson</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Duke Theseus him let out of prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freely to go, where him list over all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such a guise, as I you tellen shall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was the forword,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> plainly to indite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixte Theseus and him Arcite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if so were, that Arcite were y-found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever in his life, by day or night, one stound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any country of this Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he were caught, it was accorded thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with a sword he shoulde lose his head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was none other remedy nor rede.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But took his leave, and homeward he him sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him beware, his necke lieth to wed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How great a sorrow suff’reth now Arcite!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The death he feeleth through his hearte smite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He weepeth, waileth, crieth piteously;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slay himself he waiteth privily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said; “Alas the day that I was born!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now is my prison worse than beforn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now is me shape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> eternally to dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not in purgatory, but right in hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! that ever I knew Perithous.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For elles had I dwelt with Theseus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-fettered in his prison evermo’.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then had I been in bliss, and not in woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only the sight of her, whom that I serve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though that I never may her grace deserve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would have sufficed right enough for me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O deare cousin Palamon,” quoth he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thine is the vict’ry of this aventure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full blissfully in prison to endure:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In prison? nay certes, in paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well hath fortune y-turned thee the dice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hast the sight of her, and I th’ absence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For possible is, since thou hast her presence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And art a knight, a worthy and an able,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That by some cas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> since fortune is changeable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou may’st to thy desire sometime attain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I that am exiled, and barren</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of alle grace, and in so great despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That there n’is earthe, water, fire, nor air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor creature, that of them maked is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That may me helpe nor comfort in this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well ought I sterve in wanhope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and distress.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell my life, my lust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> and my gladness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas, why plainen men so in commune</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of purveyance of God,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> or of Fortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That giveth them full oft in many a guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well better than they can themselves devise?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some man desireth for to have richess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cause is of his murder or great sickness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some man would out of his prison fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in his house is of his meinie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Infinite harmes be in this mattere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We wot never what thing we pray for here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We fare as he that drunk is as a mouse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A drunken man wot well he hath an house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he wot not which is the right way thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to a drunken man the way is slither.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And certes in this world so fare we.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We seeke fast after felicity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we go wrong full often truely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus we may sayen all, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ween’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> and had a great opinion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if I might escape from prison</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then had I been in joy and perfect heal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where now I am exiled from my weal.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since that I may not see you, Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am but dead; there is no remedy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon that other side, Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that he wist Arcita was agone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much sorrow maketh, that the greate tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resounded of his yelling and clamour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pure fetters<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> on his shinnes great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were of his bitter salte teares wet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “Arcita, cousin mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all our strife, God wot, the fruit is thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou walkest now in Thebes at thy large,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of my woe thou givest little charge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou mayst, since thou hast wisdom and manhead,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assemble all the folk of our kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make a war so sharp on this country</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That by some aventure, or some treaty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou mayst have her to lady and to wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom that I must needes lose my life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as by way of possibility,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thou art at thy large, of prison free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And art a lord, great is thine avantage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than is mine, that sterve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> here in a cage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I must weep and wail, while that I live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the woe that prison may me give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke with pain that love me gives also,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That doubles all my torment and my woe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therewith the fire of jealousy upstart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his breast, and hent him by the heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So woodly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> that he like was to behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The box-tree, or the ashes dead and cold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then said; “O cruel goddess, that govern</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This world with binding of your word etern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>

				<span>Than is the sheep, that rouketh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in the fold!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For slain is man, right as another beast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dwelleth eke in prison and arrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hath sickness, and great adversity,</span>

				<span>That guilteless tormenteth innocence?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet increaseth this all my penance,</span>

				<span>That man is bounden to his observance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Godde’s sake to letten of his will,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereas a beast may all his lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> fulfil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when a beast is dead, he hath no pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But man after his death must weep and plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though in this worlde he have care and woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Withoute doubt it maye standen so.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The answer of this leave I to divines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But well I wot, that in this world great pine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> is;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! I see a serpent or a thief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That many a true man hath done mischief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go at his large, and where him list may turn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I must be in prison through Saturn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke through Juno, jealous and eke wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hath well nigh destroyed all the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Thebes, with his waste walles wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Venus slay’th me on that other side</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now will I stent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of Palamon a lite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let him in his prison stille dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of Arcita forth I will you tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The summer passeth, and the nightes long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Increase double-wise the paines strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both of the lover and the prisonere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I n’ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> which hath the wofuller mistere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, shortly for to say, this Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perpetually is damned to prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In chaines and in fetters to be dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arcite is exiled on his head<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For evermore as out of that country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor never more he shall his lady see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You lovers ask I now this question,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lieth the worse, Arcite or Palamon?</span>
				<br/>

				<span>But see his lady shall he never mo’.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now deem all as you liste, ye that can,</span>

			<p>
				<span>When that Arcite to Thebes comen was,</span>

				<span>And shortly to concluden all his woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much sorrow had never creature</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is or shall be while the world may dure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sleep, his meat, his drink is him byraft,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lean he wex,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and dry as any shaft.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyen hollow, grisly to behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hue sallow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> and pale as ashes cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And solitary he was, ever alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wailing all the night, making his moan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he hearde song or instrument,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would he weepen, he might not be stent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>So feeble were his spirits, and so low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And changed so, that no man coulde know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His speech, neither his voice, though men it heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his gear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> for all the world he far’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not only like the lovers’ malady</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Eros, but rather y-like manie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engender’d of humours melancholic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his head in his cell fantastic.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shortly turned was all upside down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both habit and eke dispositioun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him, this woful lover Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> Arcite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why should I all day of his woe indite?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he endured had a year or two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This cruel torment, and this pain and woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Thebes, in his country, as I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a night in sleep as he him laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him thought how that the winged god Mercury</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him stood, and bade him to be merry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sleepy yard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> in hand he bare upright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hat he wore upon his haires bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrayed was this god (as he took keep)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he was when that Argus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> took his sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said him thus: “To Athens shalt thou wend;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is thee shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> of thy woe an end.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that word Arcite woke and start.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now truely how sore that e’er me smart,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth he, “to Athens right now will I fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor for no dread of death shall I not spare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see my lady that I love and serve;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her presence I recke not to sterve.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that word he caught a great mirror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw that changed was all his colour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw his visage all in other kind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And right anon it ran him ill his mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That since his face was so disfigur’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of malady the which he had endur’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He mighte well, if that he bare him low,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Live in Athenes evermore unknow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see his lady wellnigh day by day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And right anon he changed his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clad him as a poore labourer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all alone, save only a squier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That knew his privity<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and all his cas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was disguised poorly as he was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Athens is he gone the nexte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the court he went upon a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the gate he proffer’d his service,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drudge and draw, what so men would devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, shortly of this matter for to sayn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fell in office with a chamberlain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The which that dwelling was with Emily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he was wise, and coulde soon espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of every servant which that served her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he hewe wood, and water bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he was young and mighty for the nones,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thereto he was strong and big of bones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do that any wight can him devise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A year or two he was in this service,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Page of the chamber of Emily the bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Philostrate he saide that he hight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But half so well belov’d a man as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne was there never in court of his degree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was so gentle of conditioun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That throughout all the court was his renown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They saide that it were a charity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Theseus would enhance his degree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put him in some worshipful service,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as he might his virtue exercise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus within a while his name sprung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both of his deedes, and of his good tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Theseus hath taken him so near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That of his chamber he hath made him squire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave him gold to maintain his degree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke men brought him out of his country</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From year to year full privily his rent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But honestly and slyly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> he it spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no man wonder’d how that he it had.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And three year in this wise his life be lad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bare him so in peace and eke in werre,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was no man that Theseus had so derre.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in this blisse leave I now Arcite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And speak I will of Palamon a lite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In darkness horrible, and strong prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This seven year hath sitten Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forpined,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> what for love, and for distress.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who feeleth double sorrow and heaviness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Palamon? that love distraineth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> out of his wits he went for woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke thereto he is a prisonere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perpetual, not only for a year.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who coulde rhyme in English properly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His martyrdom? forsooth, it is not I;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore I pass as lightly as I may.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It fell that in the seventh year, in May</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thirde night (as olde bookes sayn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all this story tellen more plain),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were it by a venture or destiny</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As when a thing is shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> it shall be),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That soon after the midnight, Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By helping of a friend brake his prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fled the city fast as he might go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he had given drink his gaoler so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a clary,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> made of a certain wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With narcotise and opie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> of Thebes fine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the night, though that men would him shake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gaoler slept, he mighte not awake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus he fled as fast as ever he may.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The night was short, and faste by the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That needes cast he must<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> himself to hide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to a grove faste there beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With dreadful foot then stalked Palamon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For shortly this was his opinion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in the grove he would him hide all day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the night then would he take his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Thebes-ward, his friendes for to pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Theseus to help him to warray.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shortly either he would lose his life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or winnen Emily unto his wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is th’ effect, and his intention plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now will I turn to Arcita again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That little wist how nighe was his care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till that Fortune had brought him in the snare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The busy lark, the messenger of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saluteth in her song the morning gray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fiery Phoebus riseth up so bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the orient laugheth at the sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with his streames<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> drieth in the greves<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silver droppes, hanging on the leaves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arcite, that is in the court royal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Theseus, his squier principal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ris’n, and looketh on the merry day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for to do his observance to May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering the point<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> of his desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He on his courser, starting as the fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ridden to the fieldes him to play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the court, were it a mile or tway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the grove, of which I have you told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a venture his way began to hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make him a garland of the greves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were it of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loud he sang against the sun so sheen.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O May, with all thy flowers and thy green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right welcome be thou, faire freshe May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hope that I some green here getten may.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from his courser, with a lusty heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the grove full hastily he start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a path he roamed up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as by aventure this Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in a bush, that no man might him see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sore afeard of his death was he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God wot he would have trowed it full lite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sooth is said, gone since full many years,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The field hath eyen, and the wood hath ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is full fair a man to bear him even,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all day meeten men at unset steven.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full little wot Arcite of his fellaw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was so nigh to hearken of his saw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in the bush he sitteth now full still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that Arcite had roamed all his fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sungen all the roundel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> lustily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into a study he fell suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As do those lovers in their quainte gears,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now in the crop, and now down in the breres,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now up, now down, as bucket in a well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right as the Friday, soothly for to tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now shineth it, and now it raineth fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right so can geary<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> Venus overcast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heartes of her folk, right as her day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is gearful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> right so changeth she array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seldom is Friday all the weeke like.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Arcite had y-sung, he gan to sike,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sat him down withouten any more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “the day that I was bore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How longe, Juno, through thy cruelty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou warrayen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> Thebes the city?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! y-brought is to confusion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood royal of Cadm’ and Amphion:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Thebes built, or first the town began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the city first was crowned king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his lineage am I, and his offspring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By very line, as of the stock royal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now I am so caitiff and so thrall,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he that is my mortal enemy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I serve him as his squier poorely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet doth Juno me well more shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I dare not beknow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> mine owen name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there as I was wont to hight Arcite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now hight I Philostrate, not worth a mite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! thou fell Mars, and alas! Juno,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus hath your ire our lineage all fordo’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only me, and wretched Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Theseus martyreth in prison.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over all this, to slay me utterly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love hath his fiery dart so brenningly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-sticked through my true careful heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shapen was my death erst than my shert.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye slay me with your eyen, Emily;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye be the cause wherefore that I die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the remnant of mine other care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne set I not the mountance of a tare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that I could do aught to your pleasance.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with that word he fell down in a trance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A longe time; and afterward upstart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Palamon, that thought thorough his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He felt a cold sword suddenly to glide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ire he quoke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> no longer would he hide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when that he had heard Arcite’s tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> with face dead and pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He start him up out of the bushes thick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said: “False Arcita, false traitor wick’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now art thou hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a>, that lov’st my lady so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom that I have all this pain and woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And art my blood, and to my counsel sworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I full oft have told thee herebeforn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hast bejaped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> here Duke Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And falsely changed hast thy name thus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will be dead, or elles thou shalt die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt not love my lady Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I will love her only and no mo’;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I am Palamon thy mortal foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though I have no weapon in this place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But out of prison am astart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> by grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dreade<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> not that either thou shalt die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else thou shalt not loven Emily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Choose which thou wilt, for thou shalt not astart.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This Arcite then, with full dispiteous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he him knew, and had his tale heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fierce as lion pulled out a swerd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide thus; “By God that sitt’th above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>N’ere it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> that thou art sick, and wood for love,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>Thou should’st never out of this grove pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou ne shouldest dien of mine hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I defy the surety and the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that thou sayest I have made to thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What? very fool, think well that love is free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will love her maugre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> all thy might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, for thou art a worthy gentle knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wilnest to darraine her by bataille,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have here my troth, to-morrow I will not fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without weeting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> of any other wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That here I will be founden as a knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bringe harness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> right enough for thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meat and drinke this night will I bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enough for thee, and clothes for thy bedding.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if so be that thou my lady win,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay me in this wood that I am in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou may’st well have thy lady as for me.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Palamon answer’d, “I grant it thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus they be departed till the morrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When each of them hath laid his faith to borrow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Cupid, out of alle charity!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Regne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> that wilt no fellow have with thee!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full sooth is said, that love nor lordeship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not, his thanks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> have any fellowship.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well finden that Arcite and Palamon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arcite is ridd anon unto the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the morrow, ere it were daylight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full privily two harness hath he dight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both suffisant and meete to darraine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The battle in the field betwixt them twain.</span>

				<span>And on his horse, alone as he was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He carrieth all this harness him beforn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the grove, at time and place y-set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Arcite and this Palamon be met.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then change gan the colour of their face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right as the hunter in the regne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> of Thrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That standeth at a gappe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> with a spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When hunted is the lion or the bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heareth him come rushing in the greves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breaking both the boughes and the leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinketh, “Here comes my mortal enemy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Withoute fail, he must be dead or I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For either I must slay him at the gap;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or he must slay me, if that me mishap:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fared they, in changing of their hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As far as either of them other knew.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was no good day, and no saluting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But straight, withoute wordes rehearsing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evereach of them holp to arm the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As friendly, as he were his owen brother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after that, with sharpe speares strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They foined<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> each at other wonder long.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou mightest weene,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> that this Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fighting were as a wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> lion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as a cruel tiger was Arcite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wilde boars gan they together smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That froth as white as foam, for ire wood.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up to the ancle fought they in their blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in this wise I let them fighting dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth I will of Theseus you tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Destiny, minister general,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That executeth in the world o’er all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The purveyance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> that God hath seen beforn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strong it is, that though the world had sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The contrary of a thing by yea or nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet some time it shall fallen on a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That falleth not eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> in a thousand year.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For certainly our appetites here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All is this ruled by the sight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> above.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This mean I now by mighty Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for to hunten is so desirous⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> the greate hart in May⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in his bed there dawneth him no day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he n’is clad, and ready for to ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hunt and horn, and houndes him beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in his hunting hath he such delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it is all his joy and appetite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be himself the greate harte’s bane;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For after Mars he serveth now Diane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear was the day, as I have told ere this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Theseus, with alle joy and bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his Hippolyta, the faire queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Emily, y-clothed all in green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On hunting be they ridden royally.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the grove, that stood there faste by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which there was an hart, as men him told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Duke Theseus the straighte way doth hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the laund<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> he rideth him full right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was the hart y-wont to have his flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over a brook, and so forth on his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Duke will have a course at him or tway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With houndes, such as him lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> to command.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when this Duke was come to the laund,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the sun he looked, and anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was ware of Arcite and Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That foughte breme,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> as it were bulles two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brighte swordes wente to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So hideously, that with the leaste stroke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seemed that it woulde fell an oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But what they were, nothing yet he wote.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Duke his courser with his spurres smote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at a start<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> he was betwixt them two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pulled out a sword and cried, “Ho!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more, on pain of losing of your head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By mighty Mars, he shall anon be dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That smiteth any stroke, that I may see!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But tell to me what mister<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> men ye be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That be so hardy for to fighte here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Withoute judge or other officer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though it were in listes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> royally.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Palamon answered hastily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide: “Sir, what needeth wordes mo’?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have the death deserved bothe two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two woful wretches be we, and caitives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That be accumbered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> of our own lives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So give us neither mercy nor refuge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay me first, for sainte charity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But slay my fellow eke as well as me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or slay him first; for, though thou know it lite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from thy land is banisht on his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which he hath deserved to be dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this is he that came unto thy gate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide, that he highte Philostrate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus hath he japed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> thee full many year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou hast made of him thy chief esquier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this is he, that loveth Emily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For since the day is come that I shall die</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I make pleinly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> my confession,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I am thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> woful Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hath thy prison broken wickedly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am thy mortal foe, and it am I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That so hot loveth Emily the bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I would die here present in her sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore I aske death and my jewise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But slay my fellow eke in the same wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For both we have deserved to be slain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This worthy Duke answer’d anon again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “This is a short conclusion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your own mouth, by your own confession</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath damned you, and I will it record;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It needeth not to pain you with the cord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye shall be dead, by mighty Mars the Red.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The queen anon for very womanhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to weep, and so did Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the ladies in the company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great pity was it as it thought them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever such a chance should befall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For gentle men they were, of great estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nothing but for love was this debate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They saw their bloody woundes wide and sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cried all at once, both less and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have mercy, Lord, upon us women all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on their bare knees adown they fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would have kissed his feet there as he stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at the last aslaked was his mood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For pity runneth soon in gentle heart);</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though at first for ire he quoke and start</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He hath consider’d shortly in a clause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trespass of them both, and eke the cause:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And although that his ire their guilt accused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet in his reason he them both excused;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thus; he thoughte well that every man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will help himself in love if that he can,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke deliver himself out of prison.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of women, for they wepten ever-in-one:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke his hearte had compassion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his gentle heart he thought anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soft unto himself he saide: “Fie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a lord that will have no mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But be a lion both in word and deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To them that be in repentance and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well as-to a proud dispiteous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will maintaine what he first began.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lord hath little of discretion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in such case can no division:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But weigheth pride and humbless after one.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shortly, when his ire is thus agone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gan to look on them with eyen light,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spake these same wordes all on height.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The god of love, ah! <i>benedicite</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>How mighty and how great a lord is he!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against his might there gaine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> none obstacles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He may be called a god for his miracles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he can maken at his owen guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of every heart, as that him list devise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo here this Arcite, and this Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That quietly were out of my prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And might have lived in Thebes royally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> I am their mortal enemy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that their death li’th in my might also,</span>

				<span>And yet hath love, maugre their eyen two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-brought them hither bothe for to die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now look ye, is not this an high folly?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who may not be a fool, if but he love?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold, for Godde’s sake that sits above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See how they bleed! be they not well array’d?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus hath their lord, the god of love, them paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wages and their fees for their service;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet they weene for to be full wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That serve love, for aught that may befall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this is yet the beste game<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she, for whom they have this jealousy,</span>

				<span>Can them therefor as muchel thank as me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She wot no more of all this hote fare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>

				<span>I wot it by myself full yore agone:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>

				<span>And wot how sore it can a man distrain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

				<br/>
				<span>And they him sware his asking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> fair and well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And him of lordship and of mercy pray’d,</span>

				<span>“To speak of royal lineage and richess,</span>

				<span>Though that she were a queen or a princess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each of you both is worthy doubteless</span>

				<span>To wedde when time is; but natheless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I speak as for my sister Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom ye have this strife and jealousy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye wot yourselves, she may not wed the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once, although ye fight for evermo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one of you, all be him loth or lief,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must go pipe into an ivy leaf:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is to say, she may not have you both,</span>

				<span>I trow men woulde deem it negligence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I forgot to telle the dispence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Theseus, that went so busily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To maken up the listes royally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That such a noble theatre as it was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dare well say, in all this world there n’as.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circuit a mile was about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walled of stone, and ditched all without.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round was the shape, in manner of compass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of degrees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> the height of sixty pas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when a man was set on one degree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He letted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> not his fellow for to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eastward there stood a gate of marble white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Westward right such another opposite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, shortly to conclude, such a place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was never on earth made in so little space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in the land there was no craftes-man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That geometry or arsmetrike can,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>

				<span>Nor pourtrayor,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> nor carver of images,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Theseus ne gave him meat and wages</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The theatre to make and to devise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for to do his rite and sacrifice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He eastward hath upon the gate above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In worship of Venus, goddess of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Done<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> make an altar and an oratory;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And westward, in the mind and in memory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Mars, he maked hath right such another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That coste largely of gold a fother.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And northward, in a turret on the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of alabaster white and red coral</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An oratory riche for to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In worship of Diane of chastity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath Theseus done<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> work in noble wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But yet had I forgotten to devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble carving, and the portraitures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shape, the countenance of the figures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That weren in there oratories three.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>First in the temple of Venus may’st thou see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought on the wall, full piteous to behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The broken sleepes, and the sikes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sacred teares, and the waimentings,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fiery strokes of the desirings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Love’s servants in this life endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The oathes, that their covenants assure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleasance and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauty and Youth, and Bawdry and Richess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charms and Sorc’ry, Leasings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and Flattery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispence, Business, and Jealousy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wore of yellow goldes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> a garland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had a cuckoo sitting on her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feasts, instruments, and caroles and dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lust and array, and all the circumstances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Love, which I reckon’d and reckon shall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In order, were painted on the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And more than I can make of mention.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For soothly all the mount of Citheron,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Venus hath her principal dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was showed on the wall in pourtraying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the garden, and the lustiness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor was forgot the porter Idleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor Narcissus the fair of yore agone,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet the folly of King Solomon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet the greate strength of Hercules,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ enchantments of Medea and Circes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor of Turnus the hardy fierce courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rich Croesus caitif in servage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus may ye see, that wisdom nor richess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauty, nor sleight, nor strength, nor hardiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne may with Venus holde champartie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>

				<span>For as her liste the world may she gie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, all these folk so caught were in her las<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they for woe full often said, Alas!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffice these ensamples one or two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although I could reckon a thousand mo’.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The statue of Venus, glorious to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was naked floating in the large sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the navel down all cover’d was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With waves green, and bright as any glass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A citole<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> in her right hand hadde she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on her head, full seemly for to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rose garland fresh, and well smelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above her head her doves flickering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her stood her sone Cupido,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his shoulders winges had he two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blind he was, as it is often seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Why should I not as well eke tell you all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The portraiture, that was upon the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the temple of mighty Mars the Red?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All painted was the wall in length and brede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like to the estres<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> of the grisly place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hight the great temple of Mars in Thrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> cold and frosty region,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as Mars hath his sovereign mansion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[MISSING]</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which there dwelled neither man nor beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With knotty gnarry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> barren trees old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of stubbes sharp and hideous to behold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which there ran a rumble and a sough,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though a storm should bursten every bough:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And downward from an hill under a bent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stood the temple of Mars Armipotent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought all of burnish’d steel, of which th’ entry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was long and strait, and ghastly for to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thereout came a rage and such a vise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it made all the gates for to rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The northern light in at the doore shone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For window on the walle was there none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through which men mighten any light discern.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The doors were all of adamant etern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-clenched overthwart and ende-long<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With iron tough, and, for to make it strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every pillar the temple to sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was tunne-great,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> of iron bright and sheen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There saw I first the dark imagining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of felony, and all the compassing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cruel ire, as red as any glede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The picke-purse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and eke the pale dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The smiler with the knife under the cloak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shepen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> burning with the blacke smoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The treason of the murd’ring in the bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The open war, with woundes all be-bled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conteke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> with bloody knife, and sharp menace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All full of chirking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> was that sorry place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slayer of himself eke saw I there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hearte-blood had bathed all his hair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nail y-driven in the shode<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> at night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The colde death, with mouth gaping upright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amiddes of the temple sat Mischance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With discomfort and sorry countenance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eke saw I Woodness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> laughing in his rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed Complaint, Outhees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> and fierce Outrage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The carrain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> in the bush, with throat y-corve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand slain, and not of qualm y-storve;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tyrant, with the prey by force y-reft;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The town destroy’d, that there was nothing left.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet saw I brent the shippes hoppesteres,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hunter strangled with the wilde bears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sow freting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> the child right in the cradle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cook scalded, for all his longe ladle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor was forgot, by th’infortune of Mart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The carter overridden with his cart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the wheel full low he lay adown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There were also of Mars’ division,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The armourer, the bowyer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and the smith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That forgeth sharp swordes on his stith.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all above depainted in a tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw I Conquest, sitting in great honour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> sharpe sword over his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hanging by a subtle y-twined thread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Painted the slaughter was of Julius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of cruel Nero, and Antonius:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although at that time they were yet unborn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet was their death depainted there beforn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By menacing of Mars, right by figure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So was it showed in that portraiture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As is depainted in the stars above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who shall be slain, or elles dead for love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sufficeth one ensample in stories old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I may not reckon them all, though I wo’ld.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The statue of Mars upon a carte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed, and looked grim as he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over his head there shone two figures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of starres, that be cleped in scriptures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That one Puella, that other Rubeus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>This god of armes was arrayed thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wolf there stood before him at his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With eyen red, and of a man he eat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With subtle pencil painted was this story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In redouting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> of Mars and of his glory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now to the temple of Dian the chaste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As shortly as I can I will me haste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To telle you all the descriptioun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Depainted be the walles up and down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of hunting and of shamefast chastity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There saw I how woful Calistope,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that Dian aggrieved was with her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was turned from a woman to a bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after was she made the lodestar:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus was it painted, I can say no far;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her son is eke a star as men may see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There saw I Dane<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> turn’d into a tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I meane not the goddess Diane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Peneus’ daughter, which that hight Dane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There saw I Actaeon an hart y-maked,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For vengeance that he saw Dian all naked:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw how that his houndes have him caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And freten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> him, for that they knew him not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet painted was, a little farthermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How Atalanta hunted the wild boar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Meleager, and many other mo’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which Diana wrought them care and woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There saw I many another wondrous story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The which me list not drawen to memory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This goddess on an hart full high was set,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With smalle houndes all about her feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And underneath her feet she had a moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waxing it was, and shoulde wane soon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In gaudy green her statue clothed was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bow in hand, and arrows in a case.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyen caste she full low adown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Pluto hath his darke regioun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman travailing was her beforn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, for her child so longe was unborn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full piteously Lucina<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> gan she call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide; “Help, for thou may’st best of all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he painte lifelike that it wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With many a florin he the hues had bought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now be these listes made, and Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That at his greate cost arrayed thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The temples, and the theatre every deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>When it was done, him liked wonder well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> I will of Theseus a lite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>

				<span>And speak of Palamon and of Arcite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The day approacheth of their returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That evereach an hundred knights should bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The battle to darraine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> as I you told;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to Athens, their covenant to hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath ev’reach of them brought an hundred knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well-armed for the war at alle rights.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> there trowed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> many a man,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>For to speaken of knighthood of their hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As far as God hath maked sea and land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was, of so few, so noble a company.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every wight that loved chivalry,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Had prayed, that he might be of that game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And well was him, that thereto chosen was.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if there fell to-morrow such a case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye knowe well, that every lusty knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That loveth par amour, and hath his might</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>And right so fared they with Palamon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With him there wente knightes many one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some will be armed in an habergeon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a breast-plate, and in a gipon;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some will have a pair of plates<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> large;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some will have a Prusse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> shield, or targe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some will be armed on their legges weel;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some have an axe, and some a mace of steel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is no newe guise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> but it was old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed they weren, as I have you told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evereach after his opinion.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There may’st thou see coming with Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Licurgus himself, the great king of Thrace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Black was his beard, and manly was his face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circles of his eyen in his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They glowed betwixte yellow and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a griffin looked he about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With kemped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> haires on his browes stout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His limbs were great, his brawns were hard and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His shoulders broad, his armes round and long.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the guise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> was in his country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full high upon a car of gold stood he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With foure white bulles in the trace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of coat-armour on his harness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With yellow nails, and bright as any gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had a beare’s skin, coal-black for old.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>His long hair was y-kempt behind his back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As any raven’s feather it shone for black.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wreath of gold arm-great,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> of huge weight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his head sate, full of stones bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fine rubies and clear diamants.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About his car there wente white alauns,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twenty and more, as great as any steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hunt the lion or the wilde bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And follow’d him, with muzzle fast y-bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Collars of gold, and torettes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> filed round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An hundred lordes had he in his rout,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed full well, with heartes stern and stout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With Arcita, in stories as men find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great Emetrius the king of Ind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a steede bay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> trapped in steel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cover’d with cloth of gold diapred<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came riding like the god of armes, Mars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His coat-armour was of a cloth of Tars,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> with pearls white and round and great.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His saddle was of burnish’d gold new beat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mantelet on his shoulders hanging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bretful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> of rubies red, as fire sparkling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His crispe hair like ringes was y-run,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that was yellow, glittering as the sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His nose was high, his eyen bright citrine,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lips were round, his colour was sanguine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fewe fracknes in his face y-sprent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixte yellow and black somedeal y-ment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as a lion he his looking cast.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of five and twenty year his age I cast.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>His beard was well begunnen for to spring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His voice was as a trumpet thundering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his head he wore of laurel green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A garland fresh and lusty to be seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his hand he bare, for his delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An eagle tame, as any lily white.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An hundred lordes had he with him there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All armed, save their heads, in all their gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full richely in alle manner things.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For trust ye well, that earles, dukes, and kings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were gather’d in this noble company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love, and for increase of chivalry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About this king there ran on every part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a tame lion and leopart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in this wise these lordes all and some<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be on the Sunday to the city come</span>

				<br/>
				<span>To easen them,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and do them all honour,</span>

				<span>Of none estate could amenden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The minstrelsy, the service at the feast,</span>

				<span>The greate giftes to the most and least,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rich array of Theseus’ palace,</span>

				<span>Nor who sate first or last upon the dais.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Sunday night, ere day began to spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Palamon the larke hearde sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although it were not day by houres two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet sang the lark, and Palamon right tho<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holy heart, and with an high courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arose, to wenden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> on his pilgrimage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the blissful Cithera benign,</span>

				<span>I meane Venus, honourable and digne.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> he walketh forth a pace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the listes, where her temple was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down he kneeleth, and with humble cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hearte sore, he said as ye shall hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fairest of fair, O lady mine Venus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter to Jove, and spouse of Vulcanus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou gladder of the mount of Citheron!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a> love thou haddest to Adon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have pity on my bitter teares smart,</span>

				<span>And take mine humble prayer to thine heart.</span>

				<span>Alas! I have no language to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’effecte, nor the torment of mine hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine hearte may mine harmes not betray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am so confused, that I cannot say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mercy, lady bright, that knowest well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My thought, and seest what harm that I feel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Consider all this, and rue upon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> my sore,</span>

				<span>As wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> as I shall for evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enforce my might, thy true servant to be,</span>

				<span>That make I mine avow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> so ye me help.</span>

				<span>I keepe not of armes for to yelp,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ask I not to-morrow to have victory,</span>

				<span>Of prize of armes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> blowing up and down,</span>

				<span>Of Emily, and die in her service;</span>

				<span>Find thou the manner how, and in what wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I recke not but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> it may better be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have vict’ry of them, or they of me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that I have my lady in mine arms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though so be that Mars is god of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your virtue is so great in heaven above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, if you list, I shall well have my love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy temple will I worship evermo’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on thine altar, where I ride or go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will do sacrifice, and fires bete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if ye will not so, my lady sweet,</span>

				<span>Then pray I you, to-morrow with a spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Arcita me through the hearte bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then reck I not, when I have lost my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though that Arcita win her to his wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is th’ effect and end of my prayere⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me my love, thou blissful lady dear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When th’ orison was done of Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sacrifice he did, and that anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full piteously, with alle circumstances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All tell I not as now<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> his observances.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the last the statue of Venus shook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made a signe, whereby that he took<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his prayer accepted was that day.</span>

				<span>For though the signe shewed a delay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet wist he well that granted was his boon;</span>

				<br/>
				<span>To him that meaneth well it were no charge:</span>

				<span>The fires burn upon the altar clear,</span>

				<span>While Emily was thus in her prayere:</span>

				<span>But suddenly she saw a sighte quaint.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

				<span>That other fire was queint, and all agone:</span>

				<span>As doth a brande wet in its burning.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the brandes end outran anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As it were bloody droppes many one:</span>

				<span>For which so sore aghast was Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she was well-nigh mad, and gan to cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she ne wiste what it signified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But onely for feare thus she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wept, that it was pity for to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal Diana gan appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bow in hand, right as an hunteress,</span>

				<span>And saide; “Daughter, stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> thine heaviness.</span>

				<span>And with that word, the arrows in the case<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the goddess did clatter fast and ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth she went, and made a vanishing,</span>

				<span>With piteous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> heart and high devotion</span>

				<span>Go now your way; this is the lordes will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice of the people touched the heaven,</span>

				<span>He woulde not discomforte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> them all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then said eke, that Arcite should not die,</span>

				<span>He should be healed of his malady.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of another thing they were as fain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

				<br/>
				<span>But as at jousts or at a tourneying;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For soothly there was no discomfiture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For falling is not but an aventure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>

				<span>One person all alone, withouten mo’,</span>

				<span>And home went every man the righte way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was no more but “Farewell, Have good day.”</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>But speak of Palamon and of Arcite.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Swelleth the breast of Arcite and the sore</span>

				<span>Increaseth at his hearte more and more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clotted blood, for any leache-craft,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>

				<span>This all and some is, Arcite must die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which he sendeth after Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Palamon, that was his cousin dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then said he thus, as ye shall after hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nought may the woful spirit in mine heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Declare one point of all my sorrows’ smart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To you, my lady, that I love the most:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I bequeath the service of my ghost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>To you aboven every creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since that my life ne may no longer dure.</span>

				<span>Alas, mine hearte’s queen! alas, my wife!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine hearte’s lady, ender of my life!</span>

				<span>What is this world? what aske men to have?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now with his love, now in his colde grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Al one, withouten any company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell, my sweet, farewell, mine Emily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And softly take me in your armes tway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love of God, and hearken what I say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have here with my cousin Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had strife and rancour many a day agone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love of you, and for my jealousy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Jupiter so wis my soule gie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

				<br/>
				<span>Wisdom, humbless,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> estate, and high kindred,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And if that you shall ever be a wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forget not Palamon, the gentle man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with that word his speech to fail began.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For from his feet up to his breast was come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cold of death, that had him overnome.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet moreover in his armes two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vital strength is lost, and all ago.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only the intellect, withoute more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That dwelled in his hearte sick and sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gan faile, when the hearte felte death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dusked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> his eyen two, and fail’d his breath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on his lady yet he cast his eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His laste word was; “Mercy, Emily!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His spirit changed house, and wente there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I came never I cannot telle where.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore I stent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> I am no divinister;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of soules find I nought in this register.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne me list not th’ opinions to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of them, though that they writen where they dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arcite is cold, there Mars his soule gie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now will I speake forth of Emily.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Shriek’d Emily, and howled Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Theseus his sister took anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swooning, and bare her from the corpse away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What helpeth it to tarry forth the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To telle how she wept both eve and morrow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in such cases women have such sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that their husbands be from them y-go,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for the more part they sorrow so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or elles fall into such malady,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That at the laste certainly they die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Infinite be the sorrows and the tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of olde folk, and folk of tender years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the town, for death of this Theban:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For him there weepeth bothe child and man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great a weeping was there none certain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Hector was y-brought, all fresh y-slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Troy: alas! the pity that was there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scratching of cheeks, and rending eke of hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why wouldest thou be dead?” these women cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And haddest gold enough, and Emily.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No manner man might gladden Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saving his olde father Egeus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That knew this worlde’s transmutatioun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he had seen it changen up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy after woe, and woe after gladness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shewed him example and likeness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Right as there died never man,” quoth he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That he ne liv’d in earth in some degree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right so there lived never man,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“In all this world, that sometime be not died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This world is but a throughfare full of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we be pilgrims, passing to and fro:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death is an end of every worldly sore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over all this said he yet much more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this effect, full wisely to exhort</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people, that they should them recomfort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Duke Theseus, with all his busy cure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Casteth about,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> where that the sepulture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of good Arcite may best y-maked be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke most honourable in his degree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the last he took conclusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That there as first Arcite and Palamon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hadde for love the battle them between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in that selve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> grove, sweet and green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as he had his amorous desires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His complaint, and for love his hote fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He woulde make a fire,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> in which th’ office</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of funeral he might all accomplice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let anon command<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> to hack and hew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The oakes old, and lay them on a rew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In culpons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> well arrayed for to brenne.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>His officers with swifte feet they renne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride anon at his commandement.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after this, Duke Theseus hath sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After a bier, and it all oversprad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cloth of gold, the richest that he had;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the same suit he clad Arcite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his handes were his gloves white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eke on his head a crown of laurel green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laid him bare the visage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> on the bier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therewith he wept, that pity was to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for the people shoulde see him all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When it was day he brought them to the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That roareth of the crying and the soun’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came this woful Theban, Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sluttery beard, and ruggy ashy hairs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In clothes black, y-dropped all with tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And (passing over weeping Emily)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ruefullest of all the company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And inasmuch as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> the service should be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more noble and rich in its degree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Duke Theseus let forth three steedes bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That trapped were in steel all glittering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And covered with the arms of Dan Arcite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon these steedes, that were great and white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There satte folk, of whom one bare his shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another his spear in his handes held;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thirde bare with him his bow Turkeis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

				<span>And ride forth a pace with sorrowful cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the grove, as ye shall after hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The noblest of the Greekes that there were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon their shoulders carried the bier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With slacke pace, and eyen red and wet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throughout the city, by the master street,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That spread was all with black, and wondrous high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right of the same is all the street y-wrie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the right hand went old Egeus,</span>

				<span>And on the other side Duke Theseus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With vessels in their hand of gold full fine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eke Palamon, with a great company;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after that came woful Emily,</span>

				<span>With fire in hand, as was that time the guise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do th’ office of funeral service.</span>

				<span>Of Greekes, by one general assent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then seemed me there was a parlement<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Athens, upon certain points and cas:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>

				<span>Amonge the which points y-spoken was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have with certain countries alliance,</span>

				<span>For which this noble Theseus anon</span>

				<span>Let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> send after the gentle Palamon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a> of him what was the cause and why:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in his blacke clothes sorrowfully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He came at his commandment on hie;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then sente Theseus for Emily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they were set,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a> and hush’d was all the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Theseus abided<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a> had a space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere any word came from his wise breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyen set he there as was his lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a sad visage he sighed still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after that right thus he said his will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The firste mover of the cause above</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he first made the faire chain of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great was th’ effect, and high was his intent;</span>

				<span>Well wist he why, and what thereof he meant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For with that faire chain of love he bond<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire, the air, the water, and the lond</span>

				<span>Converting all unto his proper will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which it is derived, sooth to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hereagainst no creature alive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of no degree, availeth for to strive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then is it wisdom, as it thinketh me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make a virtue of necessity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take it well, that we may not eschew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And namely what to us all is due.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whoso grudgeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> ought, he doth folly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rebel is to him that all may gie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And certainly a man hath most honour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dien in his excellence and flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he is sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> of his goode name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then hath he done his friend, nor him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> no shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gladder ought his friend be of his death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When with honour is yielded up his breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than when his name appalled is for age;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all forgotten is his vassalage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then is it best, as for a worthy fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dien when a man is best of name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The contrary of all this is wilfulness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why grudge we, why have we heaviness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That good Arcite, of chivalry the flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Departed is, with duty and honour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of this foule prison of this life?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why grudge here his cousin and his wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his welfare, that loved him so well?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can he them thank? nay, God wot, never a deal⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That both his soul and eke themselves offend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet they may their lustes not amend.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>What may I conclude of this longe serie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But after sorrow I rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> us to be merry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thanke Jupiter for all his grace?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ere that we departe from this place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rede that we make of sorrows two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One perfect joye lasting evermo’:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look now where most sorrow is herein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There will I first amenden and begin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sister,” quoth he, “this is my full assent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all th’ advice here of my parlement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gentle Palamon, your owen knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That serveth you with will, and heart, and might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever hath, since first time ye him knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye shall of your grace upon him rue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take him for your husband and your lord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lend me your hand, for this is our accord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> now of your womanly pity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is a kinge’s brother’s son, pardie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though he were a poore bachelere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he hath served you so many a year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had for you so great adversity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It muste be considered, ‘lieveth me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For gentle mercy oweth to passen right.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then said he thus to Palamon the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I trow there needeth little sermoning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make you assente to this thing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come near, and take your lady by the hand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Betwixte them was made anon the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hight matrimony or marriage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By all the counsel of the baronage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus with alle bliss and melody</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath Palamon y-wedded Emily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And God, that all this wide world hath wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send him his love, that hath it dearly bought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now is Palamon in all his weal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Living in bliss, in riches, and in heal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Emily him loves so tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he her serveth all so gentilly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never was there worde them between</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of jealousy, nor of none other teen.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus endeth Palamon and Emily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And God save all this faire company.</span>
