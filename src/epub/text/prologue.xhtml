			<p>
				<span>When that Aprilis, with his showers swoot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The drought of March hath pierced to the root,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bathed every vein in such licour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which virtue engender’d is the flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Zephyrus eke with his swoote breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inspired hath in every holt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> and heath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tender croppes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> and the younge sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath in the Ram<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> his halfe course y-run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And smalle fowles make melody,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sleepen all the night with open eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(So pricketh them nature in their corages<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a>);</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then longe folk to go on pilgrimages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And palmers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> for to seeke strange strands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ferne hallows couth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> in sundry lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And specially, from every shire’s end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Engleland, to Canterbury they wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The holy blissful Martyr for to seek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That them hath holpen, when that they were sick.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Befell that, in that season on a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Southwark at the Tabard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> as I lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready to wenden on my pilgrimage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Canterbury with devout corage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At night was come into that hostelry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well nine and twenty in a company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sundry folk, by aventure y-fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fellowship,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> and pilgrims were they all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That toward Canterbury woulde ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chamber, and the stables were wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And well we weren eased at the best.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shortly, when the sunne was to rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So had I spoken with them every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was of their fellowship anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made forword<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> early for to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take our way there as I you devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But natheless, while I have time and space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere that I farther in this tale pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me thinketh it accordant to reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tell you alle the condition</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of each of them, so as it seemed me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And which they weren, and of what degree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke in what array that they were in:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at a Knight then will I first begin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A <b>Knight</b> there was, and that a worthy man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from the time that he first began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To riden out, he loved chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth and honour, freedom and courtesy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full worthy was he in his Lorde’s war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thereto had he ridden, no man farre,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well in Christendom as in Heatheness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever honour’d for his worthiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Alisandre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> he was when it was won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full often time he had the board begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above alle nations in Prusse.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Lettowe had he reysed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> and in Russe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No Christian man so oft of his degree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Grenade at the siege eke had he be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Algesir, and ridden in Belmarie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Leyes was he, and at Satalie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they were won; and in the Greate Sea<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>At many a noble army had he be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At mortal battles had he been fifteen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And foughten for our faith at Tramissene.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In listes thries, and aye slain his foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> worthy knight had been also</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some time with the lord of Palatie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against another heathen in Turkie:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And evermore he had a sovereign price.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though that he was worthy he was wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of his port as meek as is a maid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never yet no villainy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> ne said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all his life, unto no manner wight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was a very perfect gentle knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for to telle you of his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horse was good, but yet he was not gay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fustian he weared a gipon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alle besmotter’d with his habergeon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he was late y-come from his voyage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wente for to do his pilgrimage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With him there was his son, a younge <b>Squire</b>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lover, and a lusty bacheler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lockes crulle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> as they were laid in press.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of twenty year of age he was I guess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his stature he was of even length,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wonderly deliver,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> and great of strength.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he had been some time in chevachie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Flanders, in Artois, and Picardie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And borne him well, as of so little space,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>In hope to standen in his lady’s grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Embroider’d was he, as it were a mead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All full of freshe flowers, white and red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing he was, or fluting all the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was as fresh as is the month of May.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Short was his gown, with sleeves long and wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he sit on horse, and faire ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He coulde songes make, and well indite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joust, and eke dance, and well pourtray and write.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So hot he loved, that by nightertale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He slept no more than doth the nightingale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courteous he was, lowly, and serviceable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carv’d before his father at the table.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A <b>Yeoman</b> had he, and servants no mo’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At that time, for him list ride so;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he was clad in coat and hood of green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sheaf of peacock arrows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> bright and keen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under his belt he bare full thriftily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he dress his tackle yeomanly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His arrows drooped not with feathers low;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his hand he bare a mighty bow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A nut-head<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> had he, with a brown visage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wood-craft coud<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> he well all the usage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his arm he bare a gay bracer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by his side a sword and a buckler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on that other side a gay daggere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harnessed well, and sharp as point of spear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Christopher<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> on his breast of silver sheen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An horn he bare, the baldric was of green:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A forester<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> was he soothly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> as I guess.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There was also a Nun, a <b>Prioress</b>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That of her smiling was full simple and coy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her greatest oathe was but by Saint Loy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she was cleped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> Madame Eglentine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full well she sang the service divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entuned in her nose full seemly;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And French she spake full fair and fetisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the school of Stratford atte Bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For French of Paris was to her unknow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At meate was she well y-taught withal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She let no morsel from her lippes fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wet her fingers in her sauce deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could she carry a morsel, and well keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no droppe ne fell upon her breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In courtesy was set full much her lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her over-lippe wiped she so clean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in her cup there was no farthing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of grease, when she drunken had her draught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full seemely after her meat she raught:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sickerly she was of great disport,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And full pleasant, and amiable of port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pained her to counterfeite cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of court,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and be estately of mannere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to be holden digne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> of reverence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But for to speaken of her conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was so charitable and so pitous,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>She woulde weep if that she saw a mouse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of smalle houndes had she, that she fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With roasted flesh, and milk, and wastel bread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sore she wept if one of them were dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if men smote it with a yarde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> smart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all was conscience and tender heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full seemly her wimple y-pinched was;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her nose tretis;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> her eyen gray as glass;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her mouth full small, and thereto soft and red;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sickerly she had a fair forehead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was almost a spanne broad I trow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hardily she was not undergrow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full fetis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> was her cloak, as I was ware.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of small coral about her arm she bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pair of beades, gauded all with green;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thereon hung a brooch of gold full sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On which was first y-written a crown’d A,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after, <i>Amor vincit omnia</i>.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another Nun also with her had she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[That was her chapelleine, and <b>Priestes</b> three.]</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A <b>Monk</b> there was, a fair for the mast’ry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>An out-rider, that loved venery;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>A manly man, to be an abbot able.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a dainty horse had he in stable:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he rode, men might his bridle hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jingeling<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> in a whistling wind as clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke as loud, as doth the chapel bell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as this lord was keeper of the cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rule of Saint Maur and of Saint Benet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because that it was old and somedeal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> strait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> monk let olde thinges pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And held after the newe world the trace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gave not of the text a pulled hen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That saith, that hunters be not holy men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne that a monk, when he is cloisterless;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is like to a fish that is waterless;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is to say, a monk out of his cloister.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ilke text held he not worth an oyster;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I say his opinion was good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why should he study, and make himselfe wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a book in cloister always pore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or swinken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> with his handes, and labour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Austin bid?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> how shall the world be served?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let Austin have his swink to him reserved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore he was a prickasour aright:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greyhounds he had as swift as fowl of flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of pricking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and of hunting for the hare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was all his lust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> for no cost would he spare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw his sleeves purfil’d at the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With gris,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> and that the finest of the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for to fasten his hood under his chin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had of gold y-wrought a curious pin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A love-knot in the greater end there was.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His head was bald, and shone as any glass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke his face, as it had been anoint;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was a lord full fat and in good point;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyen steep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and rolling in his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That steamed as a furnace of a lead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His bootes supple, his horse in great estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now certainly he was a fair prelate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was not pale as a forpined<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> ghost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fat swan lov’d he best of any roast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His palfrey was as brown as is a berry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A <b>Friar</b> there was, a wanton and a merry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A limitour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> a full solemne man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the orders four is none that can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much of dalliance and fair language.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had y-made full many a marriage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of younge women, at his owen cost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his order he was a noble post;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full well belov’d, and familiar was he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With franklins over all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> in his country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke with worthy women of the town:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he had power of confession,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As said himselfe, more than a curate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For of his order he was licentiate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full sweetely heard he confession,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pleasant was his absolution.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was an easy man to give penance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as he wist to have a good pittance:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>

				<span>Is signe that a man is well y-shrive.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>

				<span>For many a man so hard is of his heart,</span>

				<span>His neck was white as is the fleur-de-lis.</span>

				<span>Upon an ambler easily she sat,</span>

				<span>Y-wimpled well, and on her head an hat</span>

				<span>As broad as is a buckler or a targe.</span>

				<span>A good man there was of religion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was a poore <b>Parson</b> of a town:</span>

				<span>But rich he was of holy thought and werk:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was also a learned man, a clerk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Christe’s gospel truly woulde preach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His parishens devoutly would he teach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Benign he was, and wonder diligent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in adversity full patient:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such he was y-proved often sithes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full loth were him to curse for his tithes,</span>

				<span>But rather would he given out of doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his poore parishens about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his off’ring, and eke of his substance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could in little thing have suffisance.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide was his parish, and houses far asunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he ne left not, for no rain nor thunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sickness and in mischief to visit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The farthest in his parish, much and lit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his feet, and in his hand a staff.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This noble ensample to his sheep he gaf,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That first he wrought, and afterward he taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the gospel he the wordes caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this figure he added yet thereto,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if gold ruste, what should iron do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if a priest be foul, on whom we trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No wonder is a lewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> man to rust:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shame it is, if that a priest take keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see a shitten shepherd and clean sheep:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well ought a priest ensample for to give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By his own cleanness, how his sheep should live.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sette not his benefice to hire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left his sheep eucumber’d in the mire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ran unto London, unto Saint Paul’s,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>But dwelt at home, and kepte well his fold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the wolf ne made it not miscarry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was a shepherd, and no mercenary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though he holy were, and virtuous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was to sinful men not dispitous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>

				<span>Nor of his speeche dangerous nor dign,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in his teaching discreet and benign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drawen folk to heaven, with fairness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By good ensample, was his business:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it were<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> any person obstinate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What so he were of high or low estate,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>A better priest I trow that nowhere none is.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He waited after no pomp nor reverence,</span>

				<span>Nor maked him a spiced conscience,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Christe’s lore, and his apostles’ twelve,</span>

			<p>
				<span>With him there was a <b>Ploughman</b>, was his brother,</span>

				<span>For Christe’s sake, for every poore wight,</span>

				<span>Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His tithes payed he full fair and well,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>In a tabard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> he rode upon a mare.</span>

				<span>The <b>Miller</b> was a stout carle for the nones,</span>

				<span>There was no door, that he n’old heave off bar,</span>

				<span>His beard as any sow or fox was red,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Upon the cop<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> right of his nose he had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wart, and thereon stood a tuft of hairs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red as the bristles of a sowe’s ears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His nose-thirles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> blacke were and wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sword and buckler bare he by his side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mouth as wide was as a furnace.</span>

				<span>He was a jangler, and a goliardais,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that was most of sin and harlotries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he steale corn, and tolle thrice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet he had a thumb of gold, pardie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>A white coat and a blue hood weared he</span>

				<span>A gentle <b>Manciple</b><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> was there of a temple,</span>

				<span>Worthy to be stewards of rent and land</span>

				<span>The <b>Reeve</b><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> was a slender choleric man</span>

				<span>His beard was shav’d as nigh as ever he can.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hair was by his eares round y-shorn;</span>

				<span>His top was docked like a priest beforn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full longe were his legges, and full lean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-like a staff, there was no calf y-seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he keep a garner and a bin:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>

				<span>There was no auditor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> could on him win</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well wist he by the drought, and by the rain,</span>

				<span>The yielding of his seed and of his grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lorde’s sheep, his neat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and his dairy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His swine, his horse, his store, and his poultry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were wholly in this Reeve’s governing,</span>

				<span>Of Norfolk was this Reeve, of which I tell,</span>

				<span>Well lov’d he garlic, onions, and leeks,</span>

				<span>This Sompnour bare to him a stiff burdoun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was never trump of half so great a soun’.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But smooth it hung, as doth a strike<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of flax:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By ounces hung his lockes that he had,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewith he his shoulders oversprad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full thin it lay, by culpons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> one and one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hood for jollity, he weared none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For it was trussed up in his wallet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him thought he rode all of the newe get,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dishevel, save his cap, he rode all bare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such glaring eyen had he, as an hare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A vernicle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> had he sew’d upon his cap.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wallet lay before him in his lap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bretful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> of pardon come from Rome all hot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice he had as small as hath a goat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No beard had he, nor ever one should have.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As smooth it was as it were new y-shave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I trow he were a gelding or a mare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne was there such another pardonere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in his mail<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> he had a pillowbere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, as he saide, was our Lady’s veil:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said, he had a gobbet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> of the sail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Sainte Peter had, when that he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the sea, till Jesus Christ him hent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had a cross of latoun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> full of stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a glass he hadde pigge’s bones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with these relics, whenne that he fond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A poore parson dwelling upon lond,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a day he got him more money</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that the parson got in moneths tway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus with feigned flattering and japes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made the parson and the people his apes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But truely to tellen at the last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was in church a noble ecclesiast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well could he read a lesson or a story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alderbest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> he sang an offertory:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well he wiste, when that song was sung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He muste preach, and well afile his tongue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>To winne silver, as he right well could:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore he sang full merrily and loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now have I told you shortly in a clause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ estate, th’ array, the number, and eke the cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why that assembled was this company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Southwark at this gentle hostelry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That highte the Tabard, fast by the Bell.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now is time to you for to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How that we baren us that ilke night,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>When we were in that hostelry alight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after will I tell of our voyage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the remnant of our pilgrimage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But first I pray you of your courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye arette it not my villainy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though that I plainly speak in this mattere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tellen you their wordes and their cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not though I speak their wordes properly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this ye knowen all so well as I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whoso shall tell a tale after a man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must rehearse, as nigh as ever he can,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every word, if it be in his charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All speak he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> ne’er so rudely and so large;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or elles he must tell his tale untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or feigne things, or finde wordes new.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He may not spare, although he were his brother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must as well say one word as another.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Christ spake Himself full broad in Holy Writ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And well ye wot no villainy is it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eke Plato saith, whoso that can him read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wordes must be cousin to the deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also I pray you to forgive it me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All have I<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> not set folk in their degree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in this tale, as that they shoulden stand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My wit is short, ye may well understand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Great cheere made our Host us every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the supper set he us anon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And served us with victual of the best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong was the wine, and well to drink us lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>A seemly man Our Hoste was withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For to have been a marshal in an hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A large man he was with eyen steep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fairer burgess is there none in Cheap:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bold of his speech, and wise and well y-taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of manhoode lacked him right naught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eke thereto was he right a merry man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after supper playen he began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spake of mirth amonges other things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that we hadde made our reckonings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide thus; “Now, lordinges, truly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye be to me welcome right heartily:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by my troth, if that I shall not lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw not this year such a company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once in this herberow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> am is now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fain would I do you mirth, an<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> I wist how.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of a mirth I am right now bethought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do you ease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> and it shall coste nought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye go to Canterbury; God you speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blissful Martyr quite you your meed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And well I wot, as ye go by the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye shapen you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> to talken and to play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truely comfort nor mirth is none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride by the way as dumb as stone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore would I make you disport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I said erst, and do you some comfort.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if you liketh all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> by one assent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now for to standen at my judgement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for to worken as I shall you say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To-morrow, when ye riden on the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now by my father’s soule that is dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ye be merry, smiteth off<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> mine head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold up your hands withoute more speech.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our counsel was not longe for to seech:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Us thought it was not worth to make it wise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And granted him withoute more avise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bade him say his verdict, as him lest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lordings (quoth he), now hearken for the best;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But take it not, I pray you, in disdain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is the point, to speak it plat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That each of you, to shorten with your way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this voyage, shall tellen tales tway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Canterbury-ward, I mean it so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And homeward he shall tellen other two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of aventures that whilom have befall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And which of you that bear’th him best of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is to say, that telleth in this case</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tales of best sentence and most solace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall have a supper at your aller cost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in this place, sitting by this post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that ye come again from Canterbury.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for to make you the more merry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will myselfe gladly with you ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right at mine owen cost, and be your guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whoso will my judgement withsay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall pay for all we spenden by the way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if ye vouchesafe that it be so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me anon withoute wordes mo’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will early shape me therefore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This thing was granted, and our oath we swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With full glad heart, and prayed him also,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he would vouchesafe for to do so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that he woulde be our governour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of our tales judge and reportour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set a supper at a certain price;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we will ruled be at his device,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In high and low: and thus by one assent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We be accorded to his judgement.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thereupon the wine was fet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> anon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We drunken, and to reste went each one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Withouten any longer tarrying</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A-morrow, when the day began to spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up rose our host, and was our aller cock,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gather’d us together in a flock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth we ridden all a little space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the watering of Saint Thomas:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there our host began his horse arrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saide; “Lordes, hearken if you lest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye weet your forword,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> and I it record.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If even-song and morning-song accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let see now who shall telle the first tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As ever may I drinke wine or ale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whoso is rebel to my judgement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall pay for all that by the way is spent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now draw ye cuts, ere that ye farther twin.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He which that hath the shortest shall begin.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sir Knight (quoth he), my master and my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now draw the cut, for that is mine accord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come near (quoth he), my Lady Prioress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ye, Sir Clerk, let be your shamefastness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor study not: lay hand to, every man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Anon to drawen every wight began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shortly for to tellen as it was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were it by a venture, or sort, or cas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sooth is this, the cut fell to the Knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which full blithe and glad was every wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell he must his tale as was reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By forword, and by composition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As ye have heard; what needeth wordes mo’?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when this good man saw that it was so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he that wise was and obedient</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep his forword by his free assent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said; “Sithen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> I shall begin this game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, welcome be the cut in Godde’s name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now let us ride, and hearken what I say.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with that word we ridden forth our way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he began with right a merry cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His tale anon, and said as ye shall hear.</span>
