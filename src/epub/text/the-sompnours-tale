		<p>
		<span>The Sompnour in his stirrups high he stood,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon this Friar his hearte was so wood,* *furious</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That like an aspen leaf he quoke* for ire: *quaked, trembled</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Lordings," quoth he, "but one thing I desire;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I you beseech, that of your courtesy,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Since ye have heard this false Friar lie,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As suffer me I may my tale tell</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This Friar boasteth that he knoweth hell,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And, God it wot, that is but little wonder,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Friars and fiends be but little asunder.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For, pardie, ye have often time heard tell,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>How that a friar ravish'd was to hell</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In spirit ones by a visioun,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And, as an angel led him up and down,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To shew him all the paines that there were,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In all the place saw he not a frere;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of other folk he saw enough in woe.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unto the angel spake the friar tho;* *then</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Now, Sir,' quoth he, 'have friars such a grace,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That none of them shall come into this place?'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Yes' quoth the angel; 'many a millioun:'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And unto Satanas he led him down.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'And now hath Satanas,' said he, 'a tail</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Broader than of a carrack&lt;1&gt; is the sail.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Hold up thy tail, thou Satanas,' quoth he,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Shew forth thine erse, and let the friar see</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where is the nest of friars in this place.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And *less than half a furlong way of space* *immediately* &lt;2&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Right so as bees swarmen out of a hive,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Out of the devil's erse there gan to drive</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A twenty thousand friars *on a rout.* *in a crowd*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And throughout hell they swarmed all about,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And came again, as fast as they may gon,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And in his erse they creeped every one:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He clapt his tail again, and lay full still.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This friar, when he looked had his fill</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon the torments of that sorry place,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His spirit God restored of his grace</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Into his body again, and he awoke;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But natheless for feare yet he quoke,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So was the devil's erse aye in his mind;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That is his heritage, *of very kind* *by his very nature*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>God save you alle, save this cursed Frere;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My prologue will I end in this mannere.</span>

		<p>Notes to the Prologue to the Sompnour's Tale</p>
		<p>1. Carrack: A great ship of burden used by the Portuguese; the name is from the Italian, "cargare," to load</p>
		<p>2. In less than half a furlong way of space: immediately; literally, in less time than it takes to walk half a furlong (110 yards).</p>

		<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
		<p>
		<span>Lordings, there is in Yorkshire, as I guess,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A marshy country called Holderness,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In which there went a limitour about</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To preach, and eke to beg, it is no doubt.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And so befell that on a day this frere</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Had preached at a church in his mannere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And specially, above every thing,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Excited he the people in his preaching</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To trentals, &lt;1&gt; and to give, for Godde's sake,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wherewith men mighte holy houses make,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There as divine service is honour'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Not there as it is wasted and devour'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Nor where it needeth not for to be given,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As to possessioners, &lt;2&gt; that may liven,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thanked be God, in wealth and abundance.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Trentals," said he, "deliver from penance</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Their friendes' soules, as well old as young,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Yea, when that they be hastily y-sung, —</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Not for to hold a priest jolly and gay,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He singeth not but one mass in a day.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Deliver out," quoth he, "anon the souls.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Full hard it is, with flesh-hook or with owls* *awls</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To be y-clawed, or to burn or bake: &lt;3&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Now speed you hastily, for Christe's sake."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And when this friar had said all his intent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With qui cum patre&lt;4&gt; forth his way he went,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When folk in church had giv'n him what them lest;* *pleased</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He went his way, no longer would he rest,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With scrip and tipped staff, *y-tucked high:* *with his robe tucked</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In every house he gan to pore* and pry, up high* *peer</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And begged meal and cheese, or elles corn.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His fellow had a staff tipped with horn,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A pair of tables* all of ivory, *writing tablets</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And a pointel* y-polish'd fetisly,** *pencil **daintily</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And wrote alway the names, as he stood;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of all the folk that gave them any good,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Askaunce* that he woulde for them pray. *see note &lt;5&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Give us a bushel wheat, or malt, or rey,* *rye</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A Godde's kichel,* or a trip** of cheese, *little cake&lt;6&gt; **scrap</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Or elles what you list, we may not chese;* *choose</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A Godde's halfpenny, &lt;6&gt; or a mass penny;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Or give us of your brawn, if ye have any;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A dagon* of your blanket, leve dame, *remnant</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Our sister dear, — lo, here I write your name,—</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Bacon or beef, or such thing as ye find."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A sturdy harlot* went them aye behind, *manservant &lt;7&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That was their hoste's man, and bare a sack,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And what men gave them, laid it on his back</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And when that he was out at door, anon</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He *planed away* the names every one, *rubbed out*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That he before had written in his tables:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He served them with nifles* and with fables. — *silly tales</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Nay, there thou liest, thou Sompnour," quoth the Frere.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Peace," quoth our Host, "for Christe's mother dear;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Tell forth thy tale, and spare it not at all."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"So thrive I," quoth this Sompnour, "so I shall." —</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>So long he went from house to house, till he</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Came to a house, where he was wont to be</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Refreshed more than in a hundred places</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Sick lay the husband man, whose that the place is,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Bed-rid upon a couche low he lay:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*"Deus hic,"* quoth he; "O Thomas friend, good day," *God be here*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Said this friar, all courteously and soft.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Thomas," quoth he, "God *yield it you,* full oft *reward you for*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Have I upon this bench fared full well,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Here have I eaten many a merry meal."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And from the bench he drove away the cat,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And laid adown his potent* and his hat, *staff &lt;8&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke his scrip, and sat himself adown:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His fellow was y-walked into town</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Forth with his knave,* into that hostelry *servant</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where as he shope* him that night to lie. *shaped, purposed</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"O deare master," quoth this sicke man,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"How have ye fared since that March began?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I saw you not this fortenight and more."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"God wot," quoth he, "labour'd have I full sore;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And specially for thy salvation</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Have I said many a precious orison,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And for mine other friendes, God them bless.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I have this day been at your church at mess,* *mass</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And said sermon after my simple wit,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Not all after the text of Holy Writ;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For it is hard to you, as I suppose,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And therefore will I teach you aye the glose.* *gloss, comment</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Glosing is a full glorious thing certain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For letter slayeth, as we clerkes* sayn. *scholars</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There have I taught them to be charitable,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And spend their good where it is reasonable.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And there I saw our dame; where is she?"</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Yonder I trow that in the yard she be,"</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Saide this man; "and she will come anon."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Hey master, welcome be ye by Saint John,"</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Saide this wife; "how fare ye heartily?"</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>This friar riseth up full courteously,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And her embraceth *in his armes narrow,* *closely</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And kiss'th her sweet, and chirketh as a sparrow</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With his lippes: "Dame," quoth he, "right well,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As he that is your servant every deal.* *whit</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thanked be God, that gave you soul and life,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Yet saw I not this day so fair a wife</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In all the churche, God so save me,"</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Yea, God amend defaultes, Sir," quoth she;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Algates* welcome be ye, by my fay." *always</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Grand mercy, Dame; that have I found alway.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But of your greate goodness, by your leave,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I woulde pray you that ye not you grieve,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I will with Thomas speak *a little throw:* *a little while*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>These curates be so negligent and slow</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To grope tenderly a conscience.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In shrift* and preaching is my diligence *confession</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And study in Peter's wordes and in Paul's;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I walk and fishe Christian menne's souls,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To yield our Lord Jesus his proper rent;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To spread his word is alle mine intent."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Now by your faith, O deare Sir," quoth she,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Chide him right well, for sainte charity.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He is aye angry as is a pismire,* *ant</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Though that he have all that he can desire,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Though I him wrie* at night, and make him warm, *cover</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And ov'r him lay my leg and eke mine arm,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He groaneth as our boar that lies in sty:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Other disport of him right none have I,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I may not please him in no manner case."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"O Thomas, *je vous dis,* Thomas, Thomas, *I tell you*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This *maketh the fiend,* this must be amended. *is the devil's work*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ire is a thing that high God hath defended,* *forbidden</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And thereof will I speak a word or two."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Now, master," quoth the wife, "ere that I go,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What will ye dine? I will go thereabout."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Now, Dame," quoth he, "je vous dis sans doute, &lt;9&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Had I not of a capon but the liver,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And of your white bread not but a shiver,* *thin slice</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And after that a roasted pigge's head,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(But I would that for me no beast were dead,)</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Then had I with you homely suffisance.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I am a man of little sustenance.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My spirit hath its fost'ring in the Bible.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My body is aye so ready and penible* *painstaking</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To wake,* that my stomach is destroy'd. *watch</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I pray you, Dame, that ye be not annoy'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Though I so friendly you my counsel shew;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>By God, I would have told it but to few."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Now, Sir," quoth she, "but one word ere I go;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My child is dead within these weeke's two,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Soon after that ye went out of this town."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"His death saw I by revelatioun,"</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Said this friar, "at home in our dortour.* *dormitory &lt;10&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I dare well say, that less than half an hour</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Mter his death, I saw him borne to bliss</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In mine vision, so God me wiss.* *direct</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So did our sexton, and our fermerere,* *infirmary-keeper</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That have been true friars fifty year, —</span>
		<br/>
		<span>They may now, God be thanked of his love,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Make their jubilee, and walk above.&lt;12&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And up I rose, and all our convent eke,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With many a teare trilling on my cheek,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Withoute noise or clattering of bells,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Te Deum was our song, and nothing else,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Save that to Christ I bade an orison,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thanking him of my revelation.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For, Sir and Dame, truste me right well,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Our orisons be more effectuel,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And more we see of Christe's secret things,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Than *borel folk,* although that they be kings. *laymen*&lt;13&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>We live in povert', and in abstinence,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And borel folk in riches and dispence</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of meat and drink, and in their foul delight.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>We have this worlde's lust* all in despight** * pleasure **contempt</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lazar and Dives lived diversely,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And diverse guerdon* hadde they thereby. *reward</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And fat his soul, and keep his body lean</span>
		<br/>
		<span>We fare as saith th' apostle; cloth* and food *clothing</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Suffice us, although they be not full good.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The cleanness and the fasting of us freres</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Maketh that Christ accepteth our prayeres.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lo, Moses forty days and forty night</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Fasted, ere that the high God full of might</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Spake with him in the mountain of Sinai:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With empty womb* of fasting many a day *stomach</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Received he the lawe, that was writ</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With Godde's finger; and Eli,&lt;14&gt; well ye wit,* *know</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With highe God, that is our live's leech,* *physician, healer</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He fasted long, and was in contemplance.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Aaron, that had the temple in governance,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke the other priestes every one,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Into the temple when they shoulde gon</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To praye for the people, and do service,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>They woulde drinken in no manner wise</span>
		<br/>
		<span>No drinke, which that might them drunken make,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But there in abstinence pray and wake,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lest that they died: take heed what I say —</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But* they be sober that for the people pray — *unless</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ware that, I say — no more: for it sufficeth.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Our Lord Jesus, as Holy Writ deviseth,* *narrates</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Gave us example of fasting and prayeres:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Therefore we mendicants, we sely* freres, *simple, lowly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Be wedded to povert' and continence,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To charity, humbless, and abstinence,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To persecution for righteousness,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To weeping, misericorde,* and to cleanness. *compassion</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And therefore may ye see that our prayeres</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(I speak of us, we mendicants, we freres),</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Be to the highe God more acceptable</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Than youres, with your feastes at your table.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>From Paradise first, if I shall not lie,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Was man out chased for his gluttony,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And chaste was man in Paradise certain.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But hark now, Thomas, what I shall thee sayn;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I have no text of it, as I suppose,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But I shall find it in *a manner glose;* *a kind of comment*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That specially our sweet Lord Jesus</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Spake this of friars, when he saide thus,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Blessed be they that poor in spirit be'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And so forth all the gospel may ye see,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Whether it be liker our profession,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Or theirs that swimmen in possession;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Fy on their pomp, and on their gluttony,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And on their lewedness! I them defy.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Me thinketh they be like Jovinian,&lt;15&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Fat as a whale, and walking as a swan;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>All vinolent* as bottle in the spence;** *full of wine **store-room</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Their prayer is of full great reverence;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When they for soules say the Psalm of David,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lo, 'Buf' they say, Cor meum eructavit.&lt;16&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Who follow Christe's gospel and his lore* *doctrine</span>
		<br/>
		<span>But we, that humble be, and chaste, and pore,* *poor</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Workers of Godde's word, not auditours?* *hearers</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Therefore right as a hawk *upon a sours* *rising*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Up springs into the air, right so prayeres</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of charitable and chaste busy freres</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*Make their sours* to Godde's eares two. *rise*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thomas, Thomas, so may I ride or go,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And by that lord that called is Saint Ive,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*N'ere thou our brother, shouldest thou not thrive;* *see note &lt;17&gt;*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In our chapiter pray we day and night</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To Christ, that he thee sende health and might,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thy body for to *wielde hastily.* *soon be able to move freely*</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"God wot," quoth he, "nothing thereof feel I;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>So help me Christ, as I in fewe years</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Have spended upon *divers manner freres* *friars of various sorts*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Full many a pound, yet fare I ne'er the bet;* *better</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Certain my good have I almost beset:* *spent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Farewell my gold, for it is all ago."* *gone</span>

		<span>The friar answer'd, "O Thomas, dost thou so?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What needest thou diverse friars to seech?* *seek</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What needeth him that hath a perfect leech,* *healer</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To seeken other leeches in the town?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your inconstance is your confusioun.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Hold ye then me, or elles our convent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To praye for you insufficient?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thomas, that jape* it is not worth a mite; *jest</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your malady is *for we have too lite.* *because we have</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ah, give that convent half a quarter oats; too little*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And give that convent four and twenty groats;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And give that friar a penny, and let him go!</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Nay, nay, Thomas, it may no thing be so.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What is a farthing worth parted on twelve?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lo, each thing that is oned* in himselve *made one, united</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Is more strong than when it is y-scatter'd.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thomas, of me thou shalt not be y-flatter'd,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thou wouldest have our labour all for nought.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The highe God, that all this world hath wrought,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Saith, that the workman worthy is his hire</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thomas, nought of your treasure I desire</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As for myself, but that all our convent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To pray for you is aye so diligent:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And for to builde Christe's owen church.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Thomas, if ye will learne for to wirch,* *work</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of building up of churches may ye find</span>

		<span>If it be good, in Thomas' life of Ind.&lt;18&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ye lie here full of anger and of ire,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With which the devil sets your heart on fire,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And chide here this holy innocent</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your wife, that is so meek and patient.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And therefore trow* me, Thomas, if thee lest,** *believe **please</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ne strive not with thy wife, as for the best.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And bear this word away now, by thy faith,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Touching such thing, lo, what the wise man saith:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Within thy house be thou no lion;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To thy subjects do none oppression;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Nor make thou thine acquaintance for to flee.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And yet, Thomas, eftsoones* charge I thee, *again</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Beware from ire that in thy bosom sleeps,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ware from the serpent, that so slily creeps</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Under the grass, and stingeth subtilly.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Beware, my son, and hearken patiently,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That twenty thousand men have lost their lives</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For striving with their lemans* and their wives. *mistresses</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Now since ye have so holy and meek a wife,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What needeth you, Thomas, to make strife?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There is, y-wis,* no serpent so cruel, *certainly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When men tread on his tail nor half so fell,* *fierce</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As woman is, when she hath caught an ire;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Very* vengeance is then all her desire. *pure, only</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ire is a sin, one of the greate seven,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Abominable to the God of heaven,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to himself it is destruction.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This every lewed* vicar and parson *ignorant</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Can say, how ire engenders homicide;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ire is in sooth th' executor* of pride. *executioner</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I could of ire you say so muche sorrow,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My tale shoulde last until to-morrow.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And therefore pray I God both day and ight,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>An irous* man God send him little might. *passionate</span>
		<br/>
		<span>It is great harm, and certes great pity</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To set an irous man in high degree.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>"Whilom* there was an irous potestate,** *once **judge&lt;19&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As saith Senec, that during his estate* *term of office</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon a day out rode knightes two;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And, as fortune would that it were so,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The one of them came home, the other not.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Anon the knight before the judge is brought,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That saide thus; 'Thou hast thy fellow slain,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For which I doom thee to the death certain.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to another knight commanded he;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Go, lead him to the death, I charge thee.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And happened, as they went by the way</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Toward the place where as he should dey,* *die</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The knight came, which men weened* had been dead *thought</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Then thoughte they it was the beste rede* *counsel</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To lead them both unto the judge again.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>They saide, 'Lord, the knight hath not y-slain</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His fellow; here he standeth whole alive.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Ye shall be dead,' quoth he, 'so may I thrive,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That is to say, both one, and two, and three.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to the firste knight right thus spake he:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'I damned thee, thou must algate* be dead: *at all events</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And thou also must needes lose thine head,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For thou the cause art why thy fellow dieth.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to the thirde knight right thus he sayeth,</span>

		<span>'Thou hast not done that I commanded thee.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And thus he did do slay them alle three.</span>

		<span>Irous Cambyses was eke dronkelew,* *a drunkard</span>

		<br/>
		<span>And so befell, a lord of his meinie,* *suite</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That loved virtuous morality,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Said on a day betwixt them two right thus:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'A lord is lost, if he be vicious.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>[An irous man is like a frantic beast,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In which there is of wisdom *none arrest*;] *no control*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And drunkenness is eke a foul record</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of any man, and namely* of a lord. *especially</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There is full many an eye and many an ear</span>
		<br/>
		<span>*Awaiting on* a lord, he knows not where. *watching</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For Godde's love, drink more attemperly:* *temperately</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Wine maketh man to lose wretchedly</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His mind, and eke his limbes every one.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'The reverse shalt thou see,' quoth he, 'anon,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And prove it by thine own experience,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That wine doth to folk no such offence.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>There is no wine bereaveth me my might</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Of hand, nor foot, nor of mine eyen sight.'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And for despite he dranke muche more</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A hundred part* than he had done before, *times</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And right anon this cursed irous wretch</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This knighte's sone let* before him fetch, *caused</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Commanding him he should before him stand:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And suddenly he took his bow in hand,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And up the string he pulled to his ear,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And with an arrow slew the child right there.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>'Now whether have I a sicker* hand or non?'** *sure **not</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Quoth he; 'Is all my might and mind agone?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Hath wine bereaved me mine eyen sight?'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Why should I tell the answer of the knight?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>His son was slain, there is no more to say.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Beware therefore with lordes how ye play,* *use freedom</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Sing placebo;&lt;20&gt; and I shall if I can,</span>

		<br/>
		<span>But not t' a lord, though he should go to hell.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lo, irous Cyrus, thilke* Persian, *that</span>
		<br/>
		<span>How he destroy'd the river of Gisen,&lt;21&gt;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>For that a horse of his was drowned therein,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>When that he wente Babylon to win:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He made that the river was so small,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That women mighte wade it *over all.* *everywhere</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lo, what said he, that so well teache can,</span>

		<span>"Now, Thomas, leve* brother, leave thine ire, *dear</span>

		<span>Thine anger doth thee all too sore smart;* *pain</span>

		<span>I have him told all wholly mine estate.</span>

		<span>Now, Thomas, help for sainte charity."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And down anon he set him on his knee,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The sick man waxed well-nigh wood* for ire, *mad</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He woulde that the friar had been a-fire</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With his false dissimulation.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Such thing as is in my possession,"</span>

		<span>Ye say me thus, how that I am your brother."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Yea, certes," quoth this friar, "yea, truste well;</span>

		<br/>
		<span>"Lo here my faith, in me shall be no lack."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Then put thine hand adown right by my back,"</span>

		<span>A thing, that I have hid in privity."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Ah," thought this friar, "that shall go with me."</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And down his hand he launched to the clift,* *cleft</span>
		<br/>
		<span>In hope for to finde there a gift.</span>

		<span>And when this sicke man felte this frere</span>
		<br/>
		<span>About his taile groping there and here,</span>

		<span>There is no capel* drawing in a cart, *horse</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That might have let a fart of such a soun'.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The friar up start, as doth a wood* lioun: *fierce</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"Ah, false churl," quoth he, "for Godde's bones,</span>

		<span>This hast thou in despite done for the nones:* *on purpose</span>

		<span>His meinie,* which that heard of this affray, *servants</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Came leaping in, and chased out the frere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And forth he went with a full angry cheer* *countenance</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And fetch'd his fellow, there as lay his store:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He looked as it were a wilde boar,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And grounde with his teeth, so was he wroth.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>A sturdy pace down to the court he go'th,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Where as there wonn'd* a man of great honour, *dwelt</span>
		<br/>
		<span>To whom that he was always confessour:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>This worthy man was lord of that village.</span>

		<span>This friar came, as he were in a rage,</span>

		<span>Where as this lord sat eating at his board:</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Unnethes* might the friar speak one word, *with difficulty</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Till at the last he saide, "God you see."* *save</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span>This lord gan look, and said, "Ben'dicite!</span>
		<br/>
		<span>What? Friar John, what manner world is this?</span>
		<br/>
		<span>I see well that there something is amiss;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Ye look as though the wood were full of thieves.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Sit down anon, and tell me what your grieve* is, *grievance, grief</span>

		<span>As ye have heard before, ye know well what.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The lady of the house aye stiller sat,</span>

		</p>
		<p>
		<span>The lord sat still, as he were in a trance,</span>

		<span>And in his heart he rolled up and down,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>"How had this churl imaginatioun</span>

		<span>O nice* proude churl, I shrew** his face. *foolish **curse</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Lo, Sires," quoth the lord, "with harde grace,</span>

		<br/>
		<span>I hold him certain a demoniac.</span>

		<span>Now eat your meat, and let the churl go play,</span>

		<span>Now stood the lorde's squier at the board,</span>

		<span>Shall *perform up* the number of his convent. *complete*</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Then shall they kneel adown by one assent,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And to each spoke's end, in this mannere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Full sadly* lay his nose shall a frere; *carefully, steadily</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Your noble confessor there, God him save,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Shall hold his nose upright under the nave.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Then shall this churl, with belly stiff and tought* *tight</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As any tabour,* hither be y-brought; *drum</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And set him on the wheel right of this cart</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Upon the nave, and make him let a fart,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And ye shall see, on peril of my life,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>By very proof that is demonstrative,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That equally the sound of it will wend,* *go</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And eke the stink, unto the spokes' end,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Save that this worthy man, your confessour'</span>
		<br/>
		<span>(Because he is a man of great honour),</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Shall have the firste fruit, as reason is;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The noble usage of friars yet it is,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>The worthy men of them shall first be served,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And certainly he hath it well deserved;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He hath to-day taught us so muche good</span>
		<br/>
		<span>With preaching in the pulpit where he stood,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>That I may vouchesafe, I say for me,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He had the firste smell of fartes three;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And so would all his brethren hardily;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He beareth him so fair and holily."</span>

		<p>
		<span>The lord, the lady, and each man, save the frere,</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Saide, that Jankin spake in this mattere</span>
		<br/>
		<span>As well as Euclid, or as Ptolemy.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>Touching the churl, they said that subtilty</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And high wit made him speaken as he spake;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>He is no fool, nor no demoniac.</span>
		<br/>
		<span>And Jankin hath y-won a newe gown;</span>
		<br/>
		<span>My tale is done, we are almost at town.</span>
		</p>
		<p>Notes to the Sompnour's Tale</p>
		<p>1. Trentals: The money given to the priests for performing thirty masses for the dead, either in succession or on the anniversaries of their death; also the masses themselves, which were very profitable to the clergy.</p>
		<p>2. Possessioners: The regular religious orders, who had lands and fixed revenues; while the friars, by their vows, had to depend on voluntary contributions, though their need suggested many modes of evading the prescription.</p>
		<p>3. In Chaucer's day the most material notions about the tortures of hell prevailed, and were made the most of by the clergy, who preyed on the affection and fear of the survivors, through the ingenious doctrine of purgatory. Old paintings and illuminations represent the dead as torn by hooks, roasted in fires, boiled in pots, and subjected to many other physical torments.</p>
		<p>4. Qui cum patre: "Who with the father"; the closing words of the final benediction pronounced at Mass.</p>
		<p>5. Askaunce: The word now means sideways or asquint; here it means "as if;" and its force is probably to suggest that the second friar, with an ostentatious stealthiness, noted down the names of the liberal, to make them believe that they would be remembered in the holy beggars' orisons.</p>
		<p>6. A Godde's kichel/halfpenny: a little cake/halfpenny, given for God's sake.</p>
		<p>7. Harlot: hired servant; from Anglo-Saxon, "hyran," to hire; the word was commonly applied to males.</p>
		<p>8. Potent: staff; French, "potence," crutch, gibbet.</p>
		<p>9. Je vous dis sans doute: French; "I tell you without doubt."</p>
		<p>10. Dortour: dormitory; French, "dortoir."</p>
		<p>12. The Rules of St Benedict granted peculiar honours and immunities to monks who had lived fifty years — the jubilee period — in the order. The usual reading of the words ending the two lines is "loan" or "lone," and "alone;" but to walk alone does not seem to have been any peculiar privilege of a friar, while the idea of precedence, or higher place at table and in processions, is suggested by the reading in the text.</p>
		<p>13. Borel folk: laymen, people who are not learned; "borel" was a kind of coarse cloth.</p>
		<p>14. Eli: Elijah (1 Kings, xix.)</p>
		<p>15. An emperor Jovinian was famous in the mediaeval legends for his pride and luxury</p>
		<p>16. Cor meum eructavit: literally, "My heart has belched forth;" in our translation, (i.e. the Authorised "King James" Version - Transcriber) "My heart is inditing a goodly matter." (Ps. xlv. 1.). "Buf" is meant to represent the sound of an eructation, and to show the "great reverence" with which "those in possession," the monks of the rich monasteries, performed divine service,</p>
		<p>17. N'ere thou our brother, shouldest thou not thrive: if thou wert not of our brotherhood, thou shouldst have no hope of recovery.</p>
		<p>18. Thomas' life of Ind: The life of Thomas of India - i.e. St. Thomas the Apostle, who was said to have travelled to India.</p>
		<p>19. Potestate: chief magistrate or judge; Latin, "potestas;" Italian, "podesta." Seneca relates the story of Cornelius Piso; "De Ira," i. 16.</p>
		<p>20. Placebo: An anthem of the Roman Church, from Psalm cxvi. 9, which in the Vulgate reads, "Placebo Domino in regione vivorum" — "I will please the Lord in the land of the living"</p>
		<p>21. The Gysen: Seneca calls it the Gyndes; Sir John Mandeville tells the story of the Euphrates. "Gihon," was the name of one of the four rivers of Eden (Gen. ii, 13).</p>
		<p>22. Him that harrowed Hell: Christ. See note 14 to the Reeve's Tale.</p>
		<p>23. Mr. Wright says that "it was a common practice to grant under the conventual seal to benefactors and others a brotherly participation in the spiritual good works of the convent, and in their expected reward after death."</p>
		<p>24. The friar had received a master's degree.</p>
		<p>25. The regular number of monks or friars in a convent was fixed at twelve, with a superior, in imitation of the apostles and their Master; and large religious houses were held to consist of so many convents.</p>
