				<p>
					<span>Experience, though none authority<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were in this world, is right enough for me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak of woe that is in marriage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, lordings, since I twelve year was of age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Thanked be God that is etern on live),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Husbands at the church door have I had five⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I so often have y-wedded be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all were worthy men in their degree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But me was told, not longe time gone is</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That sithen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> Christe went never but ones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wedding, in the Cane<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> of Galilee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That by that ilk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> example taught he me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I not wedded shoulde be but once.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, hearken eke a sharp word for the nonce,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside a welle Jesus, God and man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spake in reproof of the Samaritan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou hast y-had five husbandes,” said he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> man, that now hath wedded thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not thine husband:”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> thus said he certain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What that he meant thereby, I cannot sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that I aske, why the fifthe man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not husband to the Samaritan?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many might she have in marriage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet heard I never tellen in mine age<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this number definitioun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may divine, and glosen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> up and down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But well I wot, express without a lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God bade us for to wax and multiply;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That gentle text can I well understand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eke well I wot, he said, that mine husband</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should leave father and mother, and take to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of no number mention made he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of bigamy or of octogamy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why then should men speak of it villainy?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo here, the wise king Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> Solomon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow that he had wives more than one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As would to God it lawful were to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be refreshed half so oft as he!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What gift<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> of God had he for all his wives?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No man hath such, that in this world alive is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God wot, this noble king, as to my wit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first night had many a merry fit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With each of them, so well was him on live.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessed be God that I have wedded five!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Welcome the sixth whenever that he shall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For since I will not keep me chaste in all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When mine husband is from the world y-gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some Christian man shall wedde me anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For then th’ apostle saith that I am free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wed, a’ God’s half,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> where it liketh me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saith, that to be wedded is no sin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better is to be wedded than to brin.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What recketh me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> though folk say villainy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of shrewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> Lamech, and his bigamy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well Abraham was a holy man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Jacob eke, as far as ev’r I can.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them had wives more than two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many another holy man also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where can ye see, in any manner age,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That highe God defended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By word express? I pray you tell it me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or where commanded he virginity?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot as well as you, it is no dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ apostle, when he spake of maidenhead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, that precept thereof had he none:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may counsel a woman to be one,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But counseling is no commandement;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He put it in our owen judgement.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, hadde God commanded maidenhead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then had he damned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> wedding out of dread;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certes, if there were no seed y-sow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virginity then whereof should it grow?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paul durste not commanden, at the least,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thing of which his Master gave no hest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> is set up for virginity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Catch whoso may, who runneth best let see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But this word is not ta’en of every wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> God will give it of his might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well that th’ apostle was a maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, although he wrote and said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would that every wight were such as he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All is but counsel to virginity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, since to be a wife he gave me leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of indulgence, so is it no repreve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wedde me, if that my make<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> should die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without exception<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> of bigamy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All were it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> good no woman for to touch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(He meant as in his bed or in his couch),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For peril is both fire and tow t’assemble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye know what this example may resemble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is all and some, he held virginity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More profit than wedding in frailty:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Frailty clepe I, but if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> that he and she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would lead their lives all in chastity),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I grant it well, I have of none envy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who maidenhead prefer to bigamy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It liketh them t’ be clean in body and ghost;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of mine estate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> I will not make a boast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For, well ye know, a lord in his household</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath not every vessel all of gold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some are of tree, and do their lord service.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God calleth folk to him in sundry wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each one hath of God a proper gift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some this, some that, as liketh him to shift.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virginity is great perfection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And continence eke with devotion:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Christ, that of perfection is the well,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bade not every wight he should go sell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that he had, and give it to the poor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in such wise follow him and his lore:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake to them that would live perfectly⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, lordings, by your leave, that am not I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will bestow the flower of mine age</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ acts and in the fruits of marriage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tell me also, to what conclusion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were members made of generation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of so perfect wise a wight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> y-wrought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trust me right well, they were not made for nought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glose whoso will, and say both up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they were made for the purgatioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of urine, and of other thinges smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke to know a female from a male:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for none other cause? say ye no?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Experience wot well it is not so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the clerkes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> be not with me wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say this, that they were made for both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is to say, for office,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> and for ease<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of engendrure, there we God not displease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should men elles in their bookes set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That man shall yield unto his wife her debt?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now wherewith should he make his payement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he us’d not his silly instrument?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then were they made upon a creature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To purge urine, and eke for engendrure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I say not that every wight is hold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath such harness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> as I to you told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To go and use them in engendrure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then should men take of chastity no cure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Christ was a maid, and shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> as a man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a saint, since that this world began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet ever liv’d in perfect chastity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not vie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> with no virginity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let them with bread of pured<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> wheat be fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let us wives eat our barley bread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet with barley bread, Mark tell us can,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Lord Jesus refreshed many a man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such estate as God hath cleped us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll persevere, I am not precious,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In wifehood I will use mine instrument</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As freely as my Maker hath it sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I be dangerous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> God give me sorrow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine husband shall it have, both eve and morrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that him list come forth and pay his debt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A husband will I have, I will no let,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which shall be both my debtor and my thrall,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have his tribulation withal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his flesh, while that I am his wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have the power during all my life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his proper body, and not he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right thus th’ apostle told it unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade our husbands for to love us well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All this sentence me liketh every deal.⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>Up start the Pardoner, and that anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Dame,” quoth he, “by God and by Saint John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye are a noble preacher in this case.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was about to wed a wife, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? should I bie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a> it on my flesh so dear?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet had I lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">39</a> wed no wife this year.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Abide,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">40</a> quoth she; “my tale is not begun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, thou shalt drinken of another tun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that I go, shall savour worse than ale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that I have told thee forth my tale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of tribulation in marriage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which I am expert in all mine age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(This is to say, myself hath been the whip),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

					<span>Of thilke tunne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> that I now shall broach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware of it, ere thou too nigh approach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I shall tell examples more than ten:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso will not beware by other men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By him shall other men corrected be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These same wordes writeth Ptolemy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read in his Almagest, and take it there.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dame, I would pray you, if your will it were,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this Pardoner, “as ye began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell forth your tale, and spare for no man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And teach us younge men of your practique.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Gladly,” quoth she, “since that it may you like.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that I pray to all this company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that I speak after my fantasy,</span>

					<span>To take nought agrief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> what I may say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For mine intent is only for to play.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, Sirs, then will I tell you forth my tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ever may I drinke wine or ale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall say sooth; the husbands that I had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three of them were good, and two were bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The three were goode men, and rich, and old</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> mighte they the statute hold<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which that they were bounden unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet wot well what I mean of this, pardie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As God me help, I laugh when that I think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How piteously at night I made them swink,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, by my fay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> I told of it no store:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had me giv’n their land and their treasor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me needed not do longer diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To win their love, or do them reverence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They loved me so well, by God above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I tolde no dainty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> of their love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wise woman will busy her ever-in-one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To get their love, where that she hath none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, since I had them wholly in my hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that they had me given all their land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I take keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> them for to please,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> it were for my profit, or mine ease?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I set them so a-worke, by my fay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That many a night they sange, well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bacon was not fetched for them, I trow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That some men have in Essex at Dunmow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I govern’d them so well after my law,</span>

					<span>That each of them full blissful was and fawe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bringe me gay thinges from the fair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were full glad when that I spake them fair,</span>

					<span>For, God it wot, I chid them spiteously.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>Ye wise wives, that can understand,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>A wise wife, if that she can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> her good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall beare them on hand the cow is wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take witness of her owen maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their assent: but hearken how I said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir olde kaynard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> is this thine array?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why is my neigheboure’s wife so gay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is honour’d over all where<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> she go’th,</span>

					<span>What dost thou at my neigheboure’s house?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is she so fair? art thou so amorous?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What rown’st<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> thou with our maid? <i>benedicite</i>,</span>

					<span>Sir olde lechour, let thy japes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I have a gossip, or a friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Withoute guilt), thou chidest as a fiend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that I walk or play unto his house.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou comest home as drunken as a mouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And preachest on thy bench, with evil prefe:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st to me, it is a great mischief</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wed a poore woman, for costage:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that she be rich, of high parage;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then say’st thou, that it is a tormentry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To suffer her pride and melancholy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that she be fair, thou very knave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st that every holour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> will her have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She may no while in chastity abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is assailed upon every side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st some folk desire us for richess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some for our shape, and some for our fairness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some, for she can either sing or dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some for gentiless and dalliance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some for her handes and her armes smale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus goes all to the devil, by thy tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st, men may not keep a castle wall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may be so assailed over all.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that she be foul, thou say’st that she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Coveteth every man that she may see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as a spaniel she will on him leap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she may finde some man her to cheap;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And none so grey goose goes there in the lake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(So say’st thou) that will be without a make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And say’st, it is a hard thing for to weld<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thing that no man will, his thankes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> held.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus say’st thou, lorel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> when thou go’st to bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that no wise man needeth for to wed,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st, that dropping houses, and eke smoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chiding wives, make men to flee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of their owne house; ah! <i>ben’dicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What aileth such an old man for to chide?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st, we wives will our vices hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till we be fast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and then we will them shew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may that be a proverb of a shrew.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st, that oxen, asses, horses, hounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be assayed at diverse stounds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>

					<span>Basons and lavers, ere that men them buy, seasons</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But folk of wives make none assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till they be wedded⁠—olde dotard shrew!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, say’st thou, we will our vices shew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st also, that it displeaseth me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> that thou wilt praise my beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> thou pore alway upon my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And call me faire dame in every place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> thou make a feast on thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I was born, and make me fresh and gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but thou do to my norice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to my chamberere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> within my bow’r,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And for he squireth me both up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet hast thou caught a false suspicioun:</span>

					<span>I will him not, though thou wert dead to-morrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me this, why hidest thou, with sorrow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>

					<span>Thou shalt not both, although that thou wert wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be master of my body, and my good,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>What helpeth it of me t’inquire and spyen?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow thou wouldest lock me in thy chest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shouldest say, ‘Fair wife, go where thee lest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

					<span>Of alle men most blessed may he be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wise astrologer Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> Ptolemy,</span>

					<span>That saith this proverb in his Almagest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Of alle men his wisdom is highest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That recketh not who hath the world in hand.</span>

					<span>By this proverb thou shalt well understand,</span>

					<span>Ye shall have [pleasure] right enough at eve.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st also, if that we make us gay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With clothing and with precious array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it is peril of our chastity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet⁠—with sorrow!⁠—thou enforcest thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And say’st these words in the apostle’s name:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘In habit made with chastity and shame<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye women shall apparel you,’ quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘And not in tressed hair and gay perrie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As pearles, nor with gold, nor clothes rich.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After thy text nor after thy rubrich</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not work as muchel as a gnat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou say’st also, I walk out like a cat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whoso woulde singe the catte’s skin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will the catte well dwell in her inn;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the catte’s skin be sleek and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She will not dwell in house half a day,</span>

					<span>This is to say, if I be gay, sir shrew,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Right so a wife destroyeth her husbond;</span>

					<span>Then would I say, “Now, goode lefe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> tak keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How meekly looketh Wilken oure sheep!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come near, my spouse, and let me ba<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> thy cheek.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shoulde be all patient and meek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have a sweet y-spiced<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since ye so preach of Jobe’s patience.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffer alway, since ye so well can preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> ye do, certain we shall you teach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it is fair to have a wife in peace.</span>

					<span>One of us two must bowe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> doubteless:</span>

					<span>And since a man is more reasonable</span>

					<span>Than woman is, ye must be suff’rable.</span>

					<span>What aileth you to grudge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> thus and groan?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is it for ye would have my [love] alone?</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For if I woulde sell my <i>belle chose</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I coulde walk as fresh as is a rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will keep it for your owen tooth.</span>

					<span>Ye be to blame, by God, I say you sooth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such manner wordes hadde we on hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now will I speaken of my fourth husband.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My fourthe husband was a revellour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, he had a paramour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I was young and full of ragerie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stubborn and strong, and jolly as a pie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then could I dance to a harpe smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sing, y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> as any nightingale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I had drunk a draught of sweete wine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Metellius, the foule churl, the swine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with a staff bereft his wife of life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> she drank wine, though I had been his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never should he have daunted me from drink:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after wine, of Venus most I think.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all so sure as cold engenders hail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A liquorish mouth must have a liquorish tail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In woman vinolent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> is no defence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knowe lechours by experience.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, lord Christ, when that it rememb’reth me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my youth, and on my jollity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It tickleth me about mine hearte-root;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto this day it doth mine hearte boot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I have had my world as in my time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But age, alas! that all will envenime,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath me bereft my beauty and my pith:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let go; farewell; the devil go therewith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flour is gon, there is no more to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bran, as I best may, now must I sell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet to be right merry will I fand.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now forth to tell you of my fourth husband,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, I in my heart had great despite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he of any other had delight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was quit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> by God and by Saint Joce:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made for him of the same wood a cross;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not of my body in no foul mannere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But certainly I made folk such cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his owen grease I made him fry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For anger, and for very jealousy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, in earth I was his purgatory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which I hope his soul may be in glory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God it wot, he sat full oft and sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that his shoe full bitterly him wrung.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no wight, save God and he, that wist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In many wise how sore I did him twist.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He died when I came from Jerusalem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lies in grave under the roode beam:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although his tomb is not so curious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was the sepulchre of Darius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that Apelles wrought so subtlely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is but waste to bury them preciously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him fare well, God give his soule rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is now in his grave and in his chest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now of my fifthe husband will I tell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God let his soul never come into hell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet was he to me the moste shrew;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That feel I on my ribbes all by rew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever shall, until mine ending day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in our bed he was so fresh and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal so well he could me glose,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he woulde have my <i>belle chose</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he had beaten me on every bone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet could he win again my love anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow, I lov’d him better, for that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was of his love so dangerous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We women have, if that I shall not lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this matter a quainte fantasy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever thing we may not lightly have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter will we cry all day and crave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forbid us thing, and that desire we;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Press on us fast, and thenne will we flee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With danger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> utter we all our chaffare;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great press at market maketh deare ware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And too great cheap is held at little price;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knoweth every woman that is wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My fifthe husband, God his soule bless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that I took for love and no richess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He some time was a clerk of Oxenford,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had left school, and went at home to board</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With my gossip, dwelling in oure town:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God have her soul, her name was Alisoun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She knew my heart, and all my privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bet than our parish priest, so may I the.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her betrayed I my counsel all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For had my husband pissed on a wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or done a thing that should have cost his life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her, and to another worthy wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to my niece, which that I loved well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would have told his counsel every deal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so I did full often, God it wot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made his face full often red and hot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very shame, and blam’d himself, for he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had told to me so great a privity.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell that ones in a Lent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(So oftentimes I to my gossip went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever yet I loved to be gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to walk in March, April, and May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From house to house, to heare sundry tales),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Jenkin clerk, and my gossip, Dame Ales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I myself, into the fieldes went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine husband was at London all that Lent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had the better leisure for to play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to see, and eke for to be sey<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of lusty folk; what wist I where my grace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> for to be, or in what place?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore made I my visitations</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To vigilies,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and to processions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To preachings eke, and to these pilgrimages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To plays of miracles, and marriages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weared upon me gay scarlet gites.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These wormes, nor these mothes, nor these mites</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On my apparel frett<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> them never a deal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know’st thou why? for they were used<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> well.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I telle forth what happen’d me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, that in the fieldes walked we,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till truely we had such dalliance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This clerk and I, that of my purveyance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I spake to him, and told him how that he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I were widow, shoulde wedde me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certainly, I say for no bobance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet was I never without purveyance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of marriage, nor of other thinges eke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hold a mouse’s wit not worth a leek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath but one hole for to starte to,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that faile, then is all y-do.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>[I bare him on hand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> he had enchanted me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(My dame taughte me that subtilty);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke I said, I mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> of him all night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would have slain me, as I lay upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all my bed was full of very blood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet I hop’d that he should do me good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For blood betoken’d gold, as me was taught.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all was false, I dream’d of him right naught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as I follow’d aye my dame’s lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well of that as of other things more.]</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now, sir, let me see, what shall I sayn?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aha! by God, I have my tale again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that my fourthe husband was on bier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wept algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> and made a sorry cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As wives must, for it is the usage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with my kerchief covered my visage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for I was provided with a make,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wept but little, that I undertake.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To churche was mine husband borne a-morrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With neighebours that for him made sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Jenkin, oure clerk, was one of tho:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As help me God, when that I saw him go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the bier, methought he had a pair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of legges and of feet so clean and fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all my heart I gave unto his hold.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was, I trow, a twenty winter old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I was forty, if I shall say sooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet I had always a colte’s tooth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gat-toothed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> I was, and that became me well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had the print of Sainte Venus’ seal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>[As help me God, I was a lusty one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fair, and rich, and young, and well begone:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certes I am all venerian</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In feeling, and my heart is martian;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Venus me gave my lust and liquorishness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Mars gave me my sturdy hardiness.]</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine ascendant was Taure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> and Mars therein:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I follow’d aye mine inclination</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By virtue of my constellation:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made me that I coulde not withdraw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My chamber of Venus from a good fellaw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>[Yet have I Marte’s mark upon my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And also in another privy place.</span>

					<span>For God so wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> be my salvation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I loved never by discretion,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I took no keep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> so that he liked me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How poor he was, neither of what degree.]</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What should I say? but that at the month’s end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This jolly clerk Jenkin, that was so hend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had wedded me with great solemnity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to him gave I all the land and fee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever was me given therebefore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But afterward repented me full sore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He woulde suffer nothing of my list.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, he smote me ones with his fist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that I rent out of his book a leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of the stroke mine eare wax’d all deaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stubborn I was, as is a lioness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of my tongue a very jangleress,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And walk I would, as I had done beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From house to house, although he had it sworn:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he oftentimes woulde preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And me of olde Roman gestes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that Sulpitius Gallus left his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her forsook for term of all his</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For nought but open-headed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> he her say<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looking out at his door upon a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another Roman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> told he me by name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, for his wife was at a summer game</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without his knowing, he forsook her eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then would he upon his Bible seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> proverb of Ecclesiast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he commandeth, and forbiddeth fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man shall not suffer his wife go roll about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would he say right thus withoute doubt:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>Whoso that buildeth his house all of sallows,</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>And pricketh his blind horse over the fallows,</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>And suff’reth his wife to go seeke hallows,</i>
						<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows.</i>”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all for nought; I sette not a haw<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his proverbs, nor of his olde saw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor would I not of him corrected be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hate them that my vices telle me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so do more of us (God wot) than I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This made him wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> with me all utterly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I woulde not forbear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> him in no case.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I say you sooth, by Saint Thomas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why that I rent out of his book a leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he smote me, so that I was deaf.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had a book, that gladly night and day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his disport he would it read alway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He call’d it Valerie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and Theophrast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that book he laugh’d alway full fast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke there was a clerk sometime at Rome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A cardinal, that highte Saint Jerome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made a book against Jovinian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which book was there; and eke Tertullian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chrysippus, Trotula, and Heloise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was an abbess not far from Paris;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke the Parables<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> of Solomon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ovide’s Art,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and bourdes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> many one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And alle these were bound in one volume.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every night and day was his custume</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(When he had leisure and vacation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From other worldly occupation)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To readen in this book of wicked wives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew of them more legends and more lives</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than be of goodde wives in the Bible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, trust me well, it is an impossible</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That any clerk will speake good of wives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> it be of holy saintes’ lives)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor of none other woman never the mo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who painted the lion, tell it me, who?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, if women haddde written stories,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As clerkes have within their oratories,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They would have writ of men more wickedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than all the mark of Adam<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> may redress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The children of Mercury and of Venus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be in their working full contrarious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mercury loveth wisdom and science,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Venus loveth riot and dispence.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for their diverse disposition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each falls in other’s exaltation.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thus, God wot, Mercury is desolate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Pisces, where Venus is exaltate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Venus falls where Mercury is raised.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore no woman by no clerk is praised.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clerk, when he is old, and may not do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Venus’ works not worth his olde shoe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sits he down, and writes in his dotage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That women cannot keep their marriage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now to purpose, why I tolde thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I was beaten for a book, pardie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon a night Jenkin, that was our sire,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read on his book, as he sat by the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Eva first, that for her wickedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was all mankind brought into wretchedness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which that Jesus Christ himself was slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bought us with his hearte-blood again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo here express of women may ye find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That woman was the loss of all mankind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then read he me how Samson lost his hairs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleeping, his leman cut them with her shears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through whiche treason lost he both his eyen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then read he me, if that I shall not lien,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Hercules, and of his Dejanire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That caused him to set himself on fire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing forgot he of the care and woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Socrates had with his wives two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Xantippe cast piss upon his head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly man sat still, as he were dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wip’d his head, and no more durst he sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, “Ere the thunder stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> there cometh rain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Phasiphae, that was queen of Crete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For shrewedness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> he thought the tale sweet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fy, speak no more, it is a grisly thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her horrible lust and her liking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Clytemnestra, for her lechery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That falsely made her husband for to die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He read it with full good devotion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He told me eke, for what occasion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amphiorax at Thebes lost his life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My husband had a legend of his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eryphile, that for an ouche<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> of gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had privily unto the Greekes told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where that her husband hid him in a place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he had at Thebes sorry grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Luna told he me, and of Lucie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They bothe made their husbands for to die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one for love, that other was for hate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Luna her husband on an ev’ning late</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Empoison’d had, for that she was his foe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lucia liquorish lov’d her husband so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, for he should always upon her think,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She gave him such a manner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> love-drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was dead before it were the morrow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus algates<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> husbands hadde sorrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then told he me how one Latumeus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Complained to his fellow Arius</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his garden growed such a tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which he said how that his wives three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hanged themselves for heart dispiteous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> brother,” quoth this Arius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Give me a plant of thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> blessed tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in my garden planted shall it be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of later date of wives hath he read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That some have slain their husbands in their bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let their lechour dight them all the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that the corpse lay on the floor upright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some have driven nails into their brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that they slept, and thus they have them slain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some have them given poison in their drink:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake more harm than hearte may bethink.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And therewithal he knew of more proverbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than in this world there groweth grass or herbs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Better (quoth he) thine habitation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be with a lion, or a foul dragon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than with a woman using for to chide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better (quoth he) high in the roof abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than with an angry woman in the house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be so wicked and contrarious:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They hate that their husbands loven aye.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, “A woman cast her shame away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she cast off her smock;” and farthermo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A fair woman, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> she be chaste also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is like a gold ring in a sowe’s nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who coulde ween,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> or who coulde suppose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woe that in mine heart was, and the pine?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when I saw that he would never fine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To readen on this cursed book all night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All suddenly three leaves have I plight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of his book, right as he read, and eke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I with my fist so took him on the cheek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in our fire he backward fell adown.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he up start, as doth a wood lion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his fist he smote me on the head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on the floor I lay as I were dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he saw how still that there I lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was aghast, and would have fled away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at the last out of my swoon I braid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Oh, hast thou slain me, thou false thief?” I said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And for my land thus hast thou murder’d me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere I be dead, yet will I kisse thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And near he came, and kneeled fair adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide”, “Deare sister Alisoun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As help me God, I shall thee never smite:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I have done it is thyself to wite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive it me, and that I thee beseek.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet eftsoons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> I hit him on the cheek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidde, “Thief, thus much am I awreak.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I die, I may no longer speak.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But at the last, with muche care and woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We fell accorded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> by ourselves two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave me all the bridle in mine hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the governance of house and land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his tongue, and of his hand also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made him burn his book anon right tho.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that I had gotten unto me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By mast’ry all the sovereignety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that he said, “Mine owen true wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do as thee list,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> the term of all thy life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep thine honour, and eke keep mine estate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After that day we never had debate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God help me so, I was to him as kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any wife from Denmark unto Ind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And also true, and so was he to me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God that sits in majesty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So bless his soule, for his mercy dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I say my tale, if ye will hear.⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Friar laugh’d when he had heard all this:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Dame,” quoth he, “so have I joy and bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is a long preamble of a tale.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the Sompnour heard the Friar gale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lo,” quoth this Sompnour, “Godde’s armes two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A friar will intermete<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> him evermo’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, goode men, a fly and eke a frere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will fall in ev’ry dish and eke mattere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What speak’st thou of perambulation?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? amble or trot; or peace, or go sit down:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou lettest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> our disport in this mattere.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, wilt thou so, Sir Sompnour?” quoth the Frere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now by my faith I shall, ere that I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell of a Sompnour such a tale or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the folk shall laughen in this place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now do, else, Friar, I beshrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> thy face,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth this Sompnour; “and I beshrewe me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> I telle tales two or three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of friars, ere I come to Sittingbourne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I shall make thine hearte for to mourn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well I wot thy patience is gone.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Hoste cried, “Peace, and that anon;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide, “Let the woman tell her tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye fare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> as folk that drunken be of ale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do, Dame, tell forth your tale, and that is best.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“All ready, sir,” quoth she, “right as you lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I have licence of this worthy Frere.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes, Dame,” quoth he, “tell forth, and I will hear.”</span>

					<span>In olde dayes of the king Arthour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which that Britons speake great honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All was this land full fill’d of faerie;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Elf-queen, with her jolly company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Danced full oft in many a green mead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was the old opinion, as I read;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I speak of many hundred years ago;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now can no man see none elves mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For now the great charity and prayeres</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of limitours,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and other holy freres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That search every land and ev’ry stream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thick as motes in the sunne-beam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessing halls, chambers, kitchenes, and bowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cities and burghes, castles high and towers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thorpes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and barnes, shepens<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> and dairies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This makes that there be now no faeries:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> wont to walke was an elf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There walketh now the limitour himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In undermeles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and in morrowings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saith his matins and his holy things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he goes in his limitatioun.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

					<span>Women may now go safely up and down,</span>

					<span>There is none other incubus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> but he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he will do to them no dishonour.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell it, that this king Arthour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had in his house a lusty bacheler,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on a day came riding from river:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>

					<span>Of which maiden anon, maugre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> her head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By very force he reft her maidenhead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which oppression was such clamour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such pursuit unto the king Arthour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That damned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> was this knight for to be dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By course of law, and should have lost his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Paraventure such<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> was the statute tho),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that the queen and other ladies mo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long they prayed the king of his grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he his life him granted in the place,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To choose whether she would him save or spill.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The queen thanked the king with all her might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after this, thus spake she to the knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that she saw her time upon a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou standest yet,” quoth she, “in such array,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>

					<span>Woe was the knight, and sorrowfully siked;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what? he might not do all as him liked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last he chose him for to wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And come again, right at the yeare’s end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With such answer as God would him purvey:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took his leave, and wended forth his way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He sought in ev’ry house and ev’ry place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he hoped for to finde grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To learne what thing women love the most:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he could not arrive in any coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he mighte find in this mattere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two creatures according in fere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some said that women loved best richess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some said honour, and some said jolliness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some rich array, and some said lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> a-bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And oft time to be widow and be wed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some said, that we are in our heart most eased</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that we are y-flatter’d and y-praised.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went full nigh the sooth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> I will not lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man shall win us best with flattery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with attendance, and with business</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be we y-limed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> bothe more and less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some men said that we do love the best</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to be free, and do right as us lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that no man reprove us of our vice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But say that we are wise, and nothing nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For truly there is none among us all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any wight will claw us on the gall,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That will not kick, for that he saith us sooth:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> and he shall find it, that so do’th.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For be we never so vicious within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We will be held both wise and clean of sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some men said, that great delight have we</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to be held stable and eke secre,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in one purpose steadfastly to dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not bewray a thing that men us tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that tale is not worth a rake-stele.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>

					<span>Saith, Midas had, under his longe hairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Growing upon his head two ass’s ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whiche vice he hid, as best he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full subtlely from every man’s sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, save his wife, there knew of it no mo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lov’d her most, and trusted her also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He prayed her, that to no creature</span>

					<span>She woulde tellen of his disfigure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She swore him, nay, for all the world to win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She would not do that villainy or sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make her husband have so foul a name:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She would not tell it for her owen shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless her thoughte that she died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she so longe should a counsel hide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her thought it swell’d so sore about her heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That needes must some word from her astart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, since she durst not tell it unto man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down to a marish fast thereby she ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she came there, her heart was all afire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as a bittern bumbles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in the mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She laid her mouth unto the water down</span>

					<span>Here may ye see, though we a time abide,</span>

					<span>Yet out it must, we can no counsel hide.</span>

				<p>
					<span>This knight, of whom my tale is specially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he saw he might not come thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is to say, what women love the most,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within his breast full sorrowful was his ghost.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But home he went, for he might not sojourn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day was come, that homeward he must turn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his way it happen’d him to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all his care,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> under a forest side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he saw upon a dance go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ladies four-and-twenty, and yet mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward this ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> dance he drew full yern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hope that he some wisdom there should learn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But certainly, ere he came fully there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-vanish’d was this dance, he knew not where;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No creature saw he that bare life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save on the green he sitting saw a wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fouler wight there may no man devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>

					<span>Against<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> this knight this old wife gan to rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “Sir Knight, hereforth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> lieth no way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me what ye are seeking, by your fay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paraventure it may the better be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These olde folk know muche thing.” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> mother,” quoth this knight, “certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am but dead, but if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> that I can sayn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thing it is that women most desire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could ye me wiss,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> I would well quite your hire.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Plight me thy troth here in mine hand,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The nexte thing that I require of thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt it do, if it be in thy might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I will tell it thee ere it be night.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Have here my trothe,” quoth the knight; “I grant.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thenne,” quoth she, “I dare me well avaunt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy life is safe, for I will stand thereby,</span>

					<span>Upon my life the queen will say as I:</span>

					<span>Let see, which is the proudest of them all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wears either a kerchief or a caul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dare say nay to that I shall you teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us go forth withoute longer speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rowned she a pistel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> in his ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade him to be glad, and have no fear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When they were come unto the court, this knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said, he had held his day, as he had hight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ready was his answer, as he said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a noble wife, and many a maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a widow, for that they be wise⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The queen herself sitting as a justice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assembled be, his answer for to hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward this knight was bid appear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every wight commanded was silence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the knight should tell in audience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thing that worldly women love the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knight he stood not still, as doth a beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to this question anon answer’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With manly voice, that all the court it heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My liege lady, generally,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Women desire to have the sovereignty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well over their husband as their love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to be in mast’ry him above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is your most desire, though ye me kill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do as you list, I am here at your will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the court there was no wife nor maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor widow, that contraried what he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But said, he worthy was to have his life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word up start that olde wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that the knight saw sitting on the green.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Mercy,” quoth she, “my sovereign lady queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that your court departe, do me right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I taughte this answer unto this knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he plighted me his trothe there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The firste thing I would of him requere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would it do, if it lay in his might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before this court then pray I thee, Sir Knight,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth she, “that thou me take unto thy wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well thou know’st that I have kept<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> thy life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I say false, say nay, upon thy fay.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knight answer’d, “Alas, and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know right well that such was my behest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s love choose a new request</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take all my good, and let my body go.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, then,” quoth she, “I shrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> us bothe two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though that I be old, and foul, and poor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I n’ould<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> for all the metal nor the ore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That under earth is grave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> or lies above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if thy wife I were and eke thy love.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My love?” quoth he, “nay, my damnation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! that any of my nation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should ever so foul disparaged be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all for nought; the end is this, that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constrained was, that needs he muste wed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take this olde wife, and go to bed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now woulde some men say paraventure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for my negligence I do no cure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell you all the joy and all th’ array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at the feast was made that ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which thing shortly answeren I shall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say there was no joy nor feast at all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was but heaviness and muche sorrow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For privily he wed her on the morrow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all day after hid him as an owl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So woe was him, his wife look’d so foul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great was the woe the knight had in his thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he was with his wife to bed y-brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wallow’d, and he turned to and fro.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This olde wife lay smiling evermo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “Dear husband, <i>benedicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fares every knight thus with his wife as ye?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is this the law of king Arthoures house?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is every knight of his thus dangerous?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am your owen love, and eke your wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am she, which that saved hath your life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certes yet did I you ne’er unright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why fare ye thus with me this firste night?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye fare like a man had lost his wit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is my guilt? for God’s love tell me it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it shall be amended, if I may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Amended!” quoth this knight; “alas, nay, nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It will not be amended, never mo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art so loathly, and so old also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> comest of so low a kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That little wonder though I wallow and wind;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So woulde God, mine hearte woulde brest!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is this,” quoth she, “the cause of your unrest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, certainly,” quoth he; “no wonder is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Sir,” quoth she, “I could amend all this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that me list, ere it were dayes three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So well ye mighte bear you unto me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for ye speaken of such gentleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is descended out of old richess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That therefore shalle ye be gentlemen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such arrogancy is not worth a hen.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look who that is most virtuous alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prive and apert,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and most intendeth aye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do the gentle deedes that he can;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take him for the greatest gentleman.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Christ will,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> we claim of him our gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not of our elders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> for their old richess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though they gave us all their heritage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which we claim to be of high parage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet may they not bequeathe, for no thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To none of us, their virtuous living</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made them gentlemen called to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade us follow them in such degree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well can the wise poet of Florence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That highte Dante, speak of this sentence:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, in such manner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> rhyme is Dante’s tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Full seld’ upriseth by his branches smale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prowess of man, for God of his goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wills that we claim of him our gentleness;’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of our elders may we nothing claim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But temp’ral things that man may hurt and maim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eke every wight knows this as well as I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If gentleness were planted naturally</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a certain lineage down the line,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prive and apert, then would they never fine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do of gentleness the fair office</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then might they do no villainy nor vice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let men shut the doores, and go thenne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet will the fire as fair and lighte brenne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As twenty thousand men might it behold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its office natural aye will it hold⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On peril of my life, till that it die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here may ye see well how that gentery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not annexed to possession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since folk do not their operation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alway, as doth the fire, lo, in its kind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, God it wot, men may full often find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A lorde’s son do shame and villainy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he that will have price<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> of his gent’ry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> he was boren of a gentle house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had his elders noble and virtuous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And will himselfe do no gentle deedes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor follow his gentle ancestry, that dead is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is not gentle, be he duke or earl;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For villain sinful deedes make a churl.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For gentleness is but the renomee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of thine ancestors, for their high bounte,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is a strange thing to thy person:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy gentleness cometh from God alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then comes our very<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> gentleness of grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was no thing bequeath’d us with our place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think how noble, as saith Valerius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> Tullius Hostilius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That out of povert’ rose to high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read in Senec, and read eke in Boece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There shall ye see express, that it no drede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he is gentle that doth gentle deedes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> husband, I conclude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that mine ancestors were rude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet may the highe God⁠—and so hope I⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grant me His grace to live virtuously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then am I gentle when that I begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To live virtuously, and waive<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> sin.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And whereas ye of povert’ me repreve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The highe God, on whom that we believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In wilful povert’ chose to lead his life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certes, every man, maiden, or wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May understand that Jesus, heaven’s king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne would not choose a virtuous living.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glad povert’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> is an honest thing, certain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This will Senec and other clerkes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso that holds him paid of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> his povert’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hold him rich though he hath not a shirt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He that coveteth is a poore wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he would have what is not in his might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he that nought hath, nor coveteth to have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is rich, although ye hold him but a knave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Very povert’ is sinne, properly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Juvenal saith of povert’ merrily:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The poore man, when he goes by the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the thieves he may sing and play<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Povert’ is hateful good,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A full great bringer out of business;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A great amender eke of sapience</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him that taketh it in patience.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Povert’ is this, although it seem elenge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Possession that no wight will challenge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Povert’ full often, when a man is low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Makes him his God and eke himself to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Povert’ a spectacle is,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> as thinketh me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through which he may his very<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> friendes see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, therefore, Sir, since that I you not grieve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of my povert’ no more me repreve.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now, Sir, of elde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> ye repreve me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certes, Sir, though none authority<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were in no book, ye gentles of honour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say, that men should an olde wight honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And call him father, for your gentleness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And authors shall I finden, as I guess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now there ye say that I am foul and old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then dread ye not to be a cokewold.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For filth, and elde, all so may I the,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be greate wardens upon chastity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, since I know your delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall fulfil your wordly appetite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choose now,” quoth she, “one of these thinges tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have me foul and old till that I dey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be to you a true humble wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never you displease in all my life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles will ye have me young and fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take your aventure of the repair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall be to your house because of me⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in some other place, it may well be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now choose yourselfe whether that you liketh.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This knight adviseth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> him and sore he siketh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last he said in this mannere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My lady and my love, and wife so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I put me in your wise governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choose for yourself which may be most pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And most honour to you and me also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do no force<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> the whether of the two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as you liketh, it sufficeth me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Then have I got the mastery,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Since I may choose and govern as me lest.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, certes wife,” quoth he, “I hold it best.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Kiss me,” quoth she, “we are no longer wroth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by my troth I will be to you both;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, yea, bothe fair and good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God that I may sterve wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> I to you be all so good and true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ever was wife since the world was new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> I be to-morrow as fair to seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any lady, emperess or queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is betwixt the East and eke the West</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do with my life and death right as you lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast up the curtain, and look how it is.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when the knight saw verily all this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she so fair was, and so young thereto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For joy he hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> her in his armes two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hearte bathed in a bath of bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand times on row<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> he gan her kiss:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she obeyed him in every thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mighte do him pleasance or liking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus they live unto their lives’ end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In perfect joy; and Jesus Christ us send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Husbandes meek and young, and fresh in bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And grace to overlive them that we wed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke I pray Jesus to short their lives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That will not be governed by their wives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And old and angry niggards of dispence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>God send them soon a very pestilence!</span>
