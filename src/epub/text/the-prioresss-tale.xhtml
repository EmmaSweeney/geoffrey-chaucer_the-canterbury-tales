					<span>“Well said, by <i>corpus Domini</i>,” quoth our Host;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now longe may’st thou saile by the coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou gentle Master, gentle Marinere.</span>

					<span>God give the monk a thousand last quad year!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

					<span>Aha! fellows, beware of such a jape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

					<span>As courteously as it had been a maid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My Lady Prioresse, by your leave,</span>

					<span>O Lord our Lord! thy name how marvellous</span>

					<span>Is in this large world y-spread!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> (quoth she)</span>

					<span>Which that thee bare, and is a maid alway,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>O bush unburnt, burning in Moses’ sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ravished’st down from the deity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through thy humbless, the ghost that in thee light;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Conceived was the Father’s sapience;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help me to tell it to thy reverence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lady! thy bounty, thy magnificence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy virtue, and thy great humility,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There may no tongue express in no science:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sometimes, Lady! ere men pray to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou go’st before, of thy benignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gettest us the light, through thy prayere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To guiden us unto thy son so dear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My conning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> is so weak, O blissful queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to declare thy great worthiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I not may the weight of it sustene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as a child of twelvemonth old, or less,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That can unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> any word express,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so fare I; and therefore, I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Guide my song that I shall of you say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There was in Asia, in a great city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amonges Christian folk, a Jewery,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sustained by a lord of that country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For foul usure, and lucre of villainy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hateful to Christ, and to his company;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the street men mighte ride and wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it was free, and open at each end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A little school of Christian folk there stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down at the farther end, in which there were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Children an heap y-come of Christian blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That learned in that schoole year by year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such manner doctrine as men used there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, to singen and to read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As smalle children do in their childhead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Among these children was a widow’s son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little clergion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> seven year of age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That day by day to scholay was his won,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke also, whereso he saw th’ image</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Christe’s mother, had he in usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As him was taught, to kneel adown, and say</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Ave Maria</i> as he went by the way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus had this widow her little son y-taught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our blissful Lady, Christe’s mother dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To worship aye, and he forgot it not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> child will always soone lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But aye when I remember on this mattere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saint Nicholas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> stands ever in my presence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he so young to Christ did reverence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This little child his little book learning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he sat in the school at his primere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He <i>Alma redemptoris</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> hearde sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As children learned their antiphonere;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he durst, he drew him nere and nere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hearken’d aye the wordes and the note,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he the firste verse knew all by rote.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nought wist he what this Latin was to say,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he so young and tender was of age;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But on a day his fellow gan he pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To expound him this song in his language,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or tell him why this song was in usage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This pray’d he him to construe and declare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oftentime upon his knees bare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His fellow, which that elder was than he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer’d him thus: “This song, I have heard say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was maked of our blissful Lady free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her to salute, and eke her to pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be our help and succour when we dey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can no more expound in this mattere:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I learne song, I know but small grammere.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And is this song y-made in reverence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Christe’s mother?” said this innocent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now certes I will do my diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To conne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> it all, ere Christemas be went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that I for my primer shall be shent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shall be beaten thries in an hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will it conne, our Lady to honour.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His fellow taught him homeward<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day, till he coud<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> it by rote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then he sang it well and boldely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From word to word according with the note;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twice in a day it passed through his throat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To schoole-ward, and homeward when he went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Christ’s mother was set all his intent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As I have said, throughout the Jewery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This little child, as he came to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full merrily then would he sing and cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>O Alma redemptoris</i>, evermo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sweetness hath his hearte pierced so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Christe’s mother, that to her to pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cannot stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> of singing by the way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Our firste foe, the serpent Satanas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath in Jewes’ heart his waspe’s nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upswell’d and said, “O Hebrew people, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is this to you a thing that is honest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That such a boy shall walken as him lest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In your despite, and sing of such sentence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is against your lawe’s reverence?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From thenceforth the Jewes have conspired</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This innocent out of the world to chase;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A homicide thereto have they hired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in an alley had a privy place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as the child gan forth by for to pace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cursed Jew him hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> and held him fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cut his throat, and in a pit him cast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I say that in a wardrobe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> he him threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as the Jewes purged their entrail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O cursed folk! O Herodes all new!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What may your evil intente you avail?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murder will out, certain it will not fail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> where th’ honour of God shall spread;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blood out crieth on your cursed deed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O martyr souded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> to virginity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may’st thou sing, and follow ever-in-one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The white Lamb celestial (quoth she),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the great Evangelist Saint John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Patmos wrote, which saith that they that gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before this Lamb, and sing a song all new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never fleshly woman they ne knew.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This poore widow waited all that night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After her little child, but he came not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, as soon as it was daye’s light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With face pale, in dread and busy thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She hath at school and elleswhere him sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till finally she gan so far espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was last seen in the Jewery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With mother’s pity in her breast enclosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She went, as she were half out of her mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every place, where she hath supposed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By likelihood her little child to find:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever on Christ’s mother meek and kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She cried, and at the laste thus she wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the cursed Jewes she him sought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She freined,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> and she prayed piteously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every Jew that dwelled in that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell her, if her childe went thereby;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They saide, “Nay;” but Jesus of his grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave in her thought, within a little space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in that place after her son she cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he was cast into a pit beside.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O greate God, that preformest thy laud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By mouth of innocents, lo here thy might!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This gem of chastity, this emeraud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke of martyrdom the ruby bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he with throat y-carven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> lay upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He <i>Alma Redemptoris</i> gan to sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So loud, that all the place began to ring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Christian folk, that through the streete went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In came, for to wonder on this thing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily they for the provost sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He came anon withoute tarrying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heried<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> Christ, that is of heaven king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke his mother, honour of mankind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that the Jewes let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> he bind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With torment, and with shameful death each one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The provost did<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> these Jewes for to sterve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of this murder wist, and that anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He woulde no such cursedness observe;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Evil shall have that evil will deserve;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore with horses wild he did them draw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that he hung them by the law.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The child, with piteous lamentation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was taken up, singing his song alway:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with honour and great procession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They crry him unto the next abbay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mother swooning by the biere lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> might the people that were there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This newe Rachel bringe from his bier.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon his biere lay this innocent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the altar while the masses last’;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after that, th’ abbot with his convent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have sped them for to bury him full fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they holy water on him cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet spake this child, when sprinkled was the water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sang, <i>O Alma redemptoris mater!</i></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This abbot, which that was a holy man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As monkes be, or elles ought to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This younger child to conjure he began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “O deare child! I halse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In virtue of the holy Trinity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me what is thy cause for to sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that thy throat is cut, to my seeming.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My throat is cut unto my necke-bone,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this child, “and, as by way of kind,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should have died, yea long time agone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Jesus Christ, as ye in bookes find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will that his glory last and be in mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for the worship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> of his mother dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet may I sing <i>O Alma</i> loud and clear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This well<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> of mercy, Christe’s mother sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I loved alway, after my conning:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that I my life should forlete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me she came, and bade me for to sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This anthem verily in my dying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have heard; and, when that I had sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me thought she laid a grain upon my tongue.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Wherefore I sing, and sing I must certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In honour of that blissful maiden free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till from my tongue off taken is the grain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that thus saide she to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘My little child, then will I fetche thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the grain is from thy tongue take:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be not aghast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> I will thee not forsake.’ ”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This holy monk, this abbot him mean I,</span>
					<br/>
