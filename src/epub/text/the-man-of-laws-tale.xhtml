				<p>
					<span>Our Hoste saw well that the brighte sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th' arc of his artificial day had run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fourthe part, and half an houre more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, though he were not deep expert in lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wist it was the eight-and-twenty day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of April, that is messenger to May;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw well that the shadow of every tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was in its length of the same quantity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was the body erect that caused it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore by the shadow he took his wit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Phoebus, which that shone so clear and bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Degrees was five-and-forty clomb on height;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for that day, as in that latitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was ten of the clock, he gan conclude;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly he plight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> his horse about.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"Lordings," quoth he, "I warn you all this rout,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fourthe partie of this day is gone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now for the love of God and of Saint John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lose no time, as farforth as ye may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lordings, the time wasteth night and day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And steals from us, what privily sleeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what through negligence in our waking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth the stream, that turneth never again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descending from the mountain to the plain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well might Senec, and many a philosopher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bewaile time more than gold in coffer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For loss of chattels may recover'd be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But loss of time shendeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> us, quoth he.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It will not come again, withoute dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more than will Malkin's maidenhead,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she hath lost it in her wantonness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us not moulde thus in idleness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Sir Man of Law," quoth he, "so have ye bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us a tale anon, as forword is.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>

					<span>"Hoste," quoth he, "<i>de par dieux jeo asente</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To breake forword is not mine intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behest is debt, and I would hold it fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my behest; I can no better sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such law as a man gives another wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He should himselfe usen it by right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus will our text: but natheless certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can right now no thrifty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> tale sayn,</span>

					<span>But Chaucer (though he can but lewedly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On metres and on rhyming craftily)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath said them, in such English as he can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of olde time, as knoweth many a man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he have not said them, leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In one book, he hath said them in another</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he hath told of lovers up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than Ovide made of mentioun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his Epistolae, that be full old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I telle them, since they he told?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In youth he made of Ceyx and Alcyon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since then he hath spoke of every one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These noble wives, and these lovers eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso that will his large volume seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Called the Saintes' Legend of Cupid:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

					<span>Of Lucrece, and of Babylon Thisbe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sword of Dido for the false Enee;</span>

					<span>That loved her own brother sinfully;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Of all such cursed stories I say, Fy),</span>

					<br/>
					<span>How that the cursed king Antiochus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bereft his daughter of her maidenhead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is so horrible a tale to read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he her threw upon the pavement.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore he, of full avisement,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would never write in none of his sermons</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nor I will none rehearse, if that I may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of my tale how shall I do this day?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me were loth to be liken'd doubteless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Muses, that men call Pierides<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>I speak in prose, and let him rhymes make."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word, he with a sober cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began his tale, and said as ye shall hear.</span>

					<span>O scatheful harm, condition of poverty,</span>

					<span>With thirst, with cold, with hunger so confounded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To aske help thee shameth in thine hearte;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>That very need unwrappeth all thy wound hid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maugre thine head thou must for indigence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or steal, or beg, or borrow thy dispence.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou blamest Christ, and sayst full bitterly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He misdeparteth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> riches temporal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy neighebour thou witest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> sinfully,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For he not help'd the needful in their need."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hearken what is the sentence of the wise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better to die than to have indigence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy selve neighebour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> will thee despise,</span>

					<span>Yet of the wise man take this sentence,</span>

					<span>Alle the days of poore men be wick',<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>If thou be poor, thy brother hateth thee,</span>

					<span>O riche merchants, full of wealth be ye,</span>

					<span>O noble, prudent folk, as in this case,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And tales, both of peace and of debate:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I were right now of tales desolate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that a merchant, gone in many a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me taught a tale, which ye shall after hear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In Syria whilom dwelt a company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of chapmen rich, and thereto sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clothes of gold, and satins rich of hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That widewhere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> sent their spicery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their chaffare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> was so thriftly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> and so new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every wight had dainty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> to chaffare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With them, and eke to selle them their ware.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now fell it, that the masters of that sort</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have shapen them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> to Rome for to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were it for chapmanhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> or for disport,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None other message would they thither send,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But come themselves to Rome, this is the end:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in such place as thought them a vantage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their intent, they took their herbergage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sojourned have these merchants in that town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A certain time as fell to their pleasance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, that th' excellent renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th' emperore's daughter, Dame Constance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reported was, with every circumstance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto these Syrian merchants in such wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day, as I shall you devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This was the common voice of every man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Our emperor of Rome, God him see,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A daughter hath, that since the the world began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reckon as well her goodness and beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never such another as is she:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God in honour her sustene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And would she were of all Europe the queen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"In her is highe beauty without pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And youth withoute greenhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> or folly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To all her workes virtue is her guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Humbless hath slain in her all tyranny:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is the mirror of all courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her heart a very chamber of holiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hand minister of freedom for almess."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all this voice was sooth, as God is true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now to purpose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> let us turn again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These merchants have done freight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> their shippes new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they have this blissful maiden seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home to Syria then they went full fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did their needes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> as they have done yore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And liv'd in weal;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> I can you say no more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now fell it, that these merchants stood in grace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of him that was the Soudan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> of Syrie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when they came from any strange place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would of his benigne courtesy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make them good cheer, and busily espy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tidings of sundry regnes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> for to lear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wonders that they mighte see or hear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amonges other thinges, specially</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These merchants have him told of Dame Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So great nobless, in earnest so royally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That this Soudan hath caught so great pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have her figure in his remembrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all his lust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and all his busy cure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was for to love her while his life may dure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Paraventure in thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> large book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that men call the heaven, y-written was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With starres, when that he his birthe took,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he for love should have his death, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in the starres, clearer than is glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is written, God wot, whoso could it read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The death of every man withoute dread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In starres many a winter therebeforn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was writ the death of Hector, Achilles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Pompey, Julius, ere they were born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Samson, Turnus, and of Socrates</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The death; but mennes wittes be so dull,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no wight can well read it at the full.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Soudan for his privy council sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, shortly of this matter for to pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath to them declared his intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told them certain, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> he might have grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have Constance, within a little space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was but dead; and charged them in hie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> for his life some remedy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Diverse men diverse thinges said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And arguments they casten up and down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a subtle reason forth they laid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They speak of magic, and abusion;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But finally, as in conclusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cannot see in that none avantage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor in no other way, save marriage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then saw they therein such difficulty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By way of reason, for to speak all plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that there was such diversity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between their bothe lawes, that they sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They trowe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> that no Christian prince would fain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And he answered: "Rather than I lose</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What needeth greater dilatation?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, by treaty and ambassadry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the Pope's mediation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the Church, and all the chivalry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in destruction of Mah'metry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in increase of Christe's lawe dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be accorded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> so as ye may hear;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How that the Soudan, and his baronage,</span>

					<span>And certain gold, I n'ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> what quantity,</span>

					<span>The same accord is sworn on either side;</span>

					<span>Now, fair Constance, Almighty God thee guide!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now woulde some men waiten, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I should tellen all the purveyance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which the emperor of his noblesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> for his daughter, Dame Constance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may men know that so great ordinance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May no man tellen in a little clause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was arrayed for so high a cause.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Bishops be shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> with her for to wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lordes, ladies, and knightes of renown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other folk enough, this is the end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And notified is throughout all the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every wight with great devotioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should pray to Christ, that he this marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Receive in gree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and speede this voyage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The day is comen of her departing,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say the woful fatal day is come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That there may be no longer tarrying,</span>

					<span>But forward they them dressen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> all and some.</span>

					<span>Constance, that was with sorrow all o'ercome,</span>

					<span>Full pale arose, and dressed her to wend,</span>

					<span>For well she saw there was no other end.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Alas! what wonder is it though she wept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall be sent to a strange nation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From friendes, that so tenderly her kept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to be bound under subjection</span>

					<span>of one, she knew not his condition?</span>

				<p>
					<span>To ship was brought this woeful faire maid</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Let privily her council go their way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I in this tale longer tarry?</span>

					<span>She rode unto the Soudan on a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said him, that she would reny her lay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>

					<span>That she might have the Christian folk to feast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"To please them I will do my labour."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Soudan said, "I will do at your hest,"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And kneeling, thanked her for that request;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So glad he was, he wist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> not what to say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She kiss'd her son, and home she went her way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Arrived be these Christian folk to land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Syria, with a great solemne rout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily this Soudan sent his sond,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>First to his mother, and all the realm about,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Nought, trow I, the triumph of Julius</span>

					<span>So royally, that wonder is to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And welcomed her with all joy and bliss.</span>

					<span>The time is come that this old Soudaness</span>

					<span>Ordained hath the feast of which I told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the feast the Christian folk them dress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In general, yea, bothe young and old.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For, shortly for to tell it at a word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Soudan and the Christians every one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were all to-hewn and sticked at the board,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>

					<span>She said, she was so mazed in the sea,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Honoured Christ, and heathen folk beguiled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nigh the castle such there dwelled three:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them was blind, and might not see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> it were with thilk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> eyen of his mind,</span>

					<span>With which men maye see when they be blind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Bright was the sun, as in a summer's day,</span>

					<span>For which the Constable, and his wife also,</span>

				<p>
					<span>"In the name of Christ," cried this blind Briton,</span>

					<span>This lady wax'd afrayed of that soun',<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest that her husband, shortly for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would her for Jesus Christe's love have slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Constance made her hold, and bade her wirch<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The will of Christ, as daughter of holy Church</span>

				<p>
					<span>The Constable wax'd abashed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> of that sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; "What amounteth all this fare?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constance answered; "Sir, it is Christ's might,</span>

					<span>That helpeth folk out of the fiendes snare:"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so farforth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a> she gan our law declare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she the Constable, ere that it were eve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Converted, and on Christ made him believe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Constable was not lord of the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which I speak, there as he Constance fand,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But kept it strongly many a winter space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under Alla, king of Northumberland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was full wise, and worthy of his hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the Scotes, as men may well hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But turn I will again to my mattere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Satan, that ever us waiteth to beguile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw of Constance all her perfectioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> anon how he might quite her while;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made a young knight, that dwelt in that town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love her so hot of foul affectioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That verily him thought that he should spill<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> he of her might ones have his will.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He wooed her, but it availed nought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She woulde do no sinne by no way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for despite, he compassed his thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make her a shameful death to dey;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He waiteth when the Constable is away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily upon a night he crept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Hermegilda's chamber while she slept.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Weary, forwaked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> in her orisons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleepeth Constance, and Hermegild also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knight, through Satanas' temptation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All softetly is to the bed y-go,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cut the throat of Hermegild in two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid the bloody knife by Dame Constance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went his way, there God give him mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon after came the Constable home again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke Alla that king was of that land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw his wife dispiteously<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which full oft he wept and wrung his hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ill the bed the bloody knife he fand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Dame Constance: Alas! what might she say?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very woe her wit was all away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To King Alla was told all this mischance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke the time, and where, and in what wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in a ship was founden this Constance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As here before ye have me heard devise:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The kinges heart for pity gan agrise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he saw so benign a creature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fall in disease<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and in misaventure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For as the lamb toward his death is brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So stood this innocent before the king:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false knight, that had this treason wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bore her in hand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> that she had done this thing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless there was great murmuring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the people, that say they cannot guess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she had done so great a wickedness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For they had seen her ever virtuous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loving Hermegild right as her life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this bare witness each one in that house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save he that Hermegild slew with his knife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This gentle king had caught a great motife<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this witness, and thought he would inquere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deeper into this case, the truth to lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alas! Constance, thou has no champion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor fighte canst thou not, so well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he that starf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> for our redemption,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bound Satan, and yet li'th where he lay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So be thy stronge champion this day:</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She set her down on knees, and thus she said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Immortal God, that savedest Susanne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From false blame; and thou merciful maid,</span>

				<p>
					<span>This letter said, the queen deliver'd was</span>

					<span>Of so horrible a fiendlike creature,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Alla the king came home soon after this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the castle, of the which I told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked where his wife and his child is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Constable gan about his heart feel cold,</span>

					<span>And plainly all the matter he him told</span>

					<span>As ye have heard; I can tell it no better;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shew'd the king his seal, and eke his letter</span>

				<p>
					<span>The hand was known that had the letter wrote,</span>

					<span>And all the venom of the cursed deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in what wise, certainly I know not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th' effect is this, that Alla, out of drede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mother slew, that may men plainly read,</span>

					<span>For that she traitor was to her liegeance:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ended olde Donegild with mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sorrow that this Alla night and day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made for his wife, and for his child also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no tongue that it telle may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now will I again to Constance go,</span>

					<span>Under an heathen castle, at the last,</span>

					<span>Constance and eke her child the sea upcast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almighty God, that saved all mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have on Constance and on her child some mind,</span>

					<span>That fallen is in heathen hand eftsoon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>Down from the castle came there many a wight</span>

					<span>Her leman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> be, whether she would or n'ould.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Woe was this wretched woman then begone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her child cri'd, and she cried piteously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But blissful Mary help'd her right anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, with her struggling well and mightily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thief fell overboard all suddenly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the sea he drenched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> for vengeance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus hath Christ unwemmed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> kept Constance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O foul lust of luxury! lo thine end!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only that thou faintest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> manne's mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But verily thou wilt his body shend.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th' end of thy work, or of thy lustes blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is complaining: how many may men find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That not for work, sometimes, but for th' intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do this sin, be either slain or shent?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How may this weake woman have the strength</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her to defend against this renegate?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Goliath, unmeasurable of length,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How mighte David make thee so mate?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So young, and of armour so desolate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How durst he look upon thy dreadful face?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may men see it was but Godde's grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who gave Judith courage or hardiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slay him, Holofernes, in his tent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to deliver out of wretchedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people of God? I say for this intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That right as God spirit of vigour sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To them, and saved them out of mischance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sent he might and vigour to Constance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Forth went her ship throughout the narrow mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Jubaltare and Septe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> driving alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometime west, and sometime north and south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometime east, full many a weary day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Christe's mother (blessed be she aye)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had shaped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> through her endeless goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make an end of all her heaviness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now let us stint of Constance but a throw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speak we of the Roman emperor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That out of Syria had by letters know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slaughter of Christian folk, and dishonor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Done to his daughter by a false traitor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean the cursed wicked Soudaness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at the feast let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> slay both more and less.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For which this emperor had sent anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His senator, with royal ordinance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other lordes, God wot, many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Syrians to take high vengeance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They burn and slay, and bring them to mischance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a day: but shortly this is th' end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Homeward to Rome they shaped them to wend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This senator repaired with victory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Rome-ward, sailing full royally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And met the ship driving, as saith the story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which Constance sat full piteously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing knew he what she was, nor why</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was in such array; nor she will say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her estate, although that she should dey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He brought her unto Rome, and to his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave her, and her younge son also:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the senator she led her life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus can our Lady bringen out of woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Woeful Constance, and many another mo':</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And longe time she dwelled in that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In holy works ever, as was her grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The senatores wife her aunte was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for all that she knew her ne'er the more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will no longer tarry in this case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to King Alla, whom I spake of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for his wife wept and sighed sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will return, and leave I will Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the senatores governance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>King Alla, which that had his mother slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a day fell in such repentance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, if I shortly tell it shall and plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Rome he came to receive his penitance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And put him in the Pope's ordinance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In high and low, and Jesus Christ besought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive his wicked works that he had wrought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The fame anon throughout the town is borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Alla king shall come on pilgrimage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By harbingers that wente him beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which the senator, as was usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rode him again,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and many of his lineage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well to show his high magnificence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to do any king a reverence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great cheere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> did this noble senator</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To King Alla and he to him also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of them did the other great honor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, that in a day or two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This senator did to King Alla go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feast, and shortly, if I shall not lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constance's son went in his company.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some men would say,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> at request of Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This senator had led this child to feast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not tellen every circumstance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be as be may, there was he at the least:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth is this, that at his mother's hest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before Alla during the meates space,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The child stood, looking in the kinges face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Alla king had of this child great wonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the senator he said anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Whose is that faire child that standeth yonder?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"I n'ot,"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> quoth he, "by God and by Saint John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mother he hath, but father hath he none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I of wot:" and shortly in a stound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He told to Alla how this child was found.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"But God wot," quoth this senator also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"So virtuous a liver in all my life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never saw, as she, nor heard of mo'</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of worldly woman, maiden, widow or wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare well say she hadde lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> a knife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throughout her breast, than be a woman wick',<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no man could bring her to that prick.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now was this child as like unto Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As possible is a creature to be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Alla had the face in remembrance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Dame Constance, and thereon mused he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that the childe's mother were aught she<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was his wife; and privily he sight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sped him from the table that he might.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"Parfay,"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> thought he, "phantom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> is in mine head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ought to deem, of skilful judgement,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the salte sea my wife is dead."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward he made his argument,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"What wot I, if that Christ have hither sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wife by sea, as well as he her sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To my country, from thennes that she went?"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, after noon, home with the senator.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went Alla, for to see this wondrous chance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This senator did Alla great honor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily he sent after Constance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truste well, her liste not to dance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that she wiste wherefore was that sond,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unneth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> upon her feet she mighte stand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Alla saw his wife, fair he her gret,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wept, that it was ruthe for to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For at the firste look he on her set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew well verily that it was she:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, for sorrow, as dumb stood as a tree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was her hearte shut in her distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she remember'd his unkindeness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Twice she swooned in his owen sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wept and him excused piteously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Now God," quoth he, "and all his hallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> on my soule have mercy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of your harm as guilteless am I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is Maurice my son, so like your face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Else may the fiend me fetch out of this place."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that their woeful heartes mighte cease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great was the pity for to hear them plain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through whiche plaintes gan their woe increase.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you all my labour to release,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not tell all their woe till to-morrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am so weary for to speak of sorrow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But finally, when that the sooth is wist,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Alla guiltless was of all her woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow an hundred times have they kiss'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such a bliss is there betwixt them two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, save the joy that lasteth evermo',</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is none like, that any creature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath seen, or shall see, while the world may dure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then prayed she her husband meekely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the relief of her long piteous pine,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he would pray her father specially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his majesty he would incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To vouchesafe some day with him to dine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She pray'd him eke, that he should by no way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto her father no word of her say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some men would say, how that the child Maurice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did this message unto the emperor:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, as I guess, Alla was not so nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him that is so sovereign of honor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he that is of Christian folk the flow'r,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Send any child, but better 'tis to deem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went himself; and so it may well seem.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This emperor hath granted gentilly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To come to dinner, as he him besought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> I, he looked busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this child, and on his daughter thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alla went to his inn, and as him ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arrayed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> for this feast in every wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As farforth as his cunning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> may suffice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow came, and Alla gan him dress,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke his wife, the emperor to meet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth they rode in joy and in gladness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when she saw her father in the street,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She lighted down and fell before his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Father," quoth she, "your younge child Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is now full clean out of your remembrance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"I am your daughter, your Constance," quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"That whilom ye have sent into Syrie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It am I, father, that in the salt sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was put alone, and damned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> for to die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goode father, I you mercy cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Send me no more into none heatheness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thank my lord here of his kindeness."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who can the piteous joye tellen all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt them three, since they be thus y-met?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of my tale make an end I shall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day goes fast, I will no longer let.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These gladde folk to dinner be y-set;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In joy and bliss at meat I let them dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand fold well more than I can tell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This child Maurice was since then emperor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made by the Pope, and lived Christianly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Christe's Churche did he great honor:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I let all his story passe by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Constance is my tale especially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the olde Roman gestes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> men may find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maurice's life, I bear it not in mind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This King Alla, when he his time sey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his Constance, his holy wife so sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To England are they come the righte way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where they did live in joy and in quiet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But little while it lasted, I you hete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy of this world for time will not abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to night it changeth as the tide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who liv'd ever in such delight one day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That him not moved either conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ire, or talent, or some kind affray,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Envy, or pride, or passion, or offence?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say but for this ende this sentence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That little while in joy or in pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lasted the bliss of Alla with Constance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For death, that takes of high and low his rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When passed was a year, even as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of this world this King Alla he hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whom Constance had full great heaviness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let us pray that God his soule bless:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dame Constance, finally to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the town of Rome went her way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To Rome is come this holy creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And findeth there her friendes whole and sound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now is she scaped all her aventure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that she her father hath y-found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down on her knees falleth she to ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping for tenderness in hearte blithe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She herieth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> God an hundred thousand sithe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In virtue and in holy almes-deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They liven all, and ne'er asunder wend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till death departeth them, this life they lead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fare now well, my tale is at an end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Jesus Christ, that of his might may send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy after woe, govern us in his grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keep us alle that be in this place.</span>
