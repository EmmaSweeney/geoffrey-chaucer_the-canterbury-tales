					<span>This worthy limitour, this noble Frere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made always a manner louring cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the Sompnour; but for honesty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No villain word as yet to him spake he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last he said unto the Wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dame,” quoth he, “God give you right good life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have here touched, all so may I the,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In school matter a greate difficulty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have said muche thing right well, I say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Dame, here as we ride by the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us needeth not but for to speak of game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leave authorities, in Godde’s name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To preaching, and to school eke of clergy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if it like unto this company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you of a Sompnour tell a game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pardie, ye may well knowe by the name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of a Sompnour may no good be said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray that none of you be evil paid;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Sompnour is a runner up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mandements<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> for fornicatioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is y-beat at every towne’s end.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spake our Host; “Ah, sir, ye should be hend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And courteous, as a man of your estate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In company we will have no debate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us your tale, and let the Sompnour be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the Sompnour, “let him say by me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What so him list; when it comes to my lot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I shall him quiten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> every groat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall him telle what a great honour</span>

					<span>It is to be a flattering limitour</span>

					<span>And his office I shall him tell y-wis”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answered, “Peace, no more of this.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Whilom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> there was dwelling in my country</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An archdeacon, a man of high degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That boldely did execution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In punishing of fornication,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of witchecraft, and eke of bawdery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of defamation, and adultery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of churche-reeves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and of testaments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of contracts, and of lack of sacraments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke of many another manner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which needeth not rehearsen at this time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of usury, and simony also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, certes, lechours did he greatest woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shoulde singen, if that they were hent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smale tithers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> were foul y-shent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any person would on them complain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There might astert them no pecunial pain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For smalle tithes, and small offering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made the people piteously to sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ere the bishop caught them with his crook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They weren in the archedeacon’s book;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then had he, through his jurisdiction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Power to do on them correction.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had a Sompnour ready to his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A slier boy was none in Engleland;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For subtlely he had his espiaille,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That taught him well where it might aught avail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coulde spare of lechours one or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To teache him to four and twenty mo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For⁠—though this Sompnour wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> be as a hare⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell his harlotry I will not spare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For we be out of their correction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have of us no jurisdiction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne never shall have, term of all their lives.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Peter; so be the women of the stives,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth this Sompnour, “y-put out of our cure.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Peace, with mischance and with misaventure,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Hoste said, “and let him tell his tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now telle forth, and let the Sompnour gale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor spare not, mine owen master dear.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This false thief, the Sompnour (quoth the Frere),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had always bawdes ready to his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any hawk to lure in Engleland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That told him all the secrets that they knew⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their acquaintance was not come of new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were his approvers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> privily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took himself at great profit thereby:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His master knew not always what he wan.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute mandement, a lewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could summon, on pain of Christe’s curse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they were inly glad to fill his purse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make him greate feastes at the nale.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right as Judas hadde purses smale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was a thief, right such a thief was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His master had but half his duety.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was (if I shall give him his laud)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thief, and eke a Sompnour, and a bawd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he had wenches at his retinue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That whether that Sir Robert or Sir Hugh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Jack, or Ralph, or whoso that it were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lay by them, they told it in his ear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus were the wench and he of one assent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he would fetch a feigned mandement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the chapter summon them both two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pill<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> the man, and let the wenche go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would he say, “Friend, I shall for thy sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do strike thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> out of oure letters blake;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee thar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> no more as in this case travail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am thy friend where I may thee avail.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certain he knew of bribers many mo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than possible is to tell in yeare’s two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in this world is no dog for the bow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That can a hurt deer from a whole know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> than this Sompnour knew a sly lechour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or an adult’rer, or a paramour:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for that was the fruit of all his rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore on it he set all his intent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell, that once upon a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour, waiting ever on his prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rode forth to summon a widow, an old ribibe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Feigning a cause, for he would have a bribe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happen’d that he saw before him ride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gay yeoman under a forest side:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had upon a courtepy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> of green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hat upon his head with fringes blake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” quoth this Sompnour, “hail, and well o’ertake.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Welcome,” quoth he, “and every good fellaw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whither ridest thou under this green shaw?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this yeoman; “wilt thou far to-day?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour answer’d him, and saide, “Nay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here faste by,” quoth he, “is mine intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ride, for to raisen up a rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That longeth to my lorde’s duety.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah! art thou then a bailiff?” “Yea,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He durste not for very filth and shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say that he was a Sompnour, for the name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>De par dieux</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> quoth this yeoman, “leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art a bailiff, and I am another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am unknowen, as in this country.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of thine acquaintance I will praye thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke of brotherhood, if that thee list.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have gold and silver lying in my chest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that thee hap to come into our shire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All shall be thine, right as thou wilt desire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>Grand mercy</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> quoth this Sompnour, “by my faith.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each in the other’s hand his trothe lay’th,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to be sworne brethren till they dey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In dalliance they ride forth and play.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Sompnour, which that was as full of jangles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As full of venom be those wariangles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ev’r inquiring upon every thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Brother,” quoth he, “where is now your dwelling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another day if that I should you seech?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This yeoman him answered in soft speech;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brother,” quoth he, “far in the North country,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as I hope some time I shall thee see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere we depart I shall thee so well wiss,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of mine house shalt thou never miss.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, brother,” quoth this Sompnour, “I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Teach me, while that we ride by the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Since that ye be a bailiff as am I,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some subtilty, and tell me faithfully</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For mine office how that I most may win.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spare not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> for conscience or for sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, as my brother, tell me how do ye.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now by my trothe, brother mine,” said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I shall tell to thee a faithful tale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wages be full strait and eke full smale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord is hard to me and dangerous,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mine office is full laborious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore by extortion I live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forsooth I take all that men will me give.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> by sleighte, or by violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From year to year I win all my dispence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can no better tell thee faithfully.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now certes,” quoth this Sompnour, “so fare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I spare not to take, God it wot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> it be too heavy or too hot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I may get in counsel privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No manner conscience of that have I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>N’ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> mine extortion, I might not live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of such japes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> will I not be shrive.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stomach nor conscience know I none;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> these shrifte-fathers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> every one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well be we met, by God and by St. Jame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, leve brother, tell me then thy name,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth this Sompnour. Right in this meane while</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This yeoman gan a little for to smile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Brother,” quoth he, “wilt thou that I thee tell?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a fiend, my dwelling is in hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here I ride about my purchasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To know where men will give me any thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My purchase is th’ effect of all my rent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look how thou ridest for the same intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To winne good, thou reckest never how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so fare I, for ride will I now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the worlde’s ende for a prey.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah,” quoth this Sompnour, “<i>benedicite!</i> what say y’?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I weened<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> ye were a yeoman truly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have a manne’s shape as well as I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have ye then a figure determinate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In helle, where ye be in your estate?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, certainly,” quoth he, there have we none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when us liketh we can take us one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles make you seem<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> that we be shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometime like a man, or like an ape;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or like an angel can I ride or go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no wondrous thing though it be so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A lousy juggler can deceive thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pardie, yet can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> I more craft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> than he.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why,” quoth the Sompnour, “ride ye then or gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sundry shapes and not always in one?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For we,” quoth he, “will us in such form make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As most is able our prey for to take.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What maketh you to have all this labour?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Full many a cause, leve Sir Sompnour,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this fiend. “But all thing hath a time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day is short and it is passed prime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet have I won nothing in this day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will intend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> to winning, if I may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not intend our thinges to declare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, brother mine, thy wit is all too bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To understand, although I told them thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> thou askest why laboure we:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sometimes we be Godde’s instruments</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And meanes to do his commandements,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that him list, upon his creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In divers acts and in divers figures:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute him we have no might certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that him list to stande thereagain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes, at our prayer have we leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only the body, not the soul, to grieve:</span>
					<br/>

					<span>This is to say, on soul and body eke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes be we suffer’d for to seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a man and do his soul unrest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not his body, and all is for the best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he withstandeth our temptation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is a cause of his salvation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that it was not our intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He should be safe, but that we would him hent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>

					<span>And sometimes be we servants unto man,</span>

					<span>Make ye you newe bodies thus alway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ elements?” The fiend answered, “Nay:</span>

					<span>With deade bodies, in full sundry wise,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For I will holde company with thee,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth this Sompnour, “that shall ne’er betide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a yeoman, that is known full wide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trothe will I hold, as in this case;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though thou wert the devil Satanas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trothe will I hold to thee, my brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have sworn, and each of us to other,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And if that any of us have more than other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him be true, and part it with his brother.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I grante,” quoth the devil, “by my fay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word they rode forth their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right at th’ent’ring of the towne’s end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which this Sompnour shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> him for to wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They saw a cart, that charged was with hay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that a carter drove forth on his way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep was the way, for which the carte stood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carter smote, and cried as he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Heit Scot! heit Brok! what, spare ye for the stones?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fiend (quoth he) you fetch body and bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As farforthly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> as ever ye were foal’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So muche woe as I have with you tholed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil have all, horses, and cart, and hay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Sompnour said, “Here shall we have a prey,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And near the fiend he drew, as nought ne were,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily, and rowned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> in his ear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hearken, my brother, hearken, by thy faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearest thou not, how that the carter saith?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> it anon, for he hath giv’n it thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both hay and cart, and eke his capels<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> three.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the devil, “God wot, never a deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not his intent, trust thou me well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ask him thyself, if thou not trowest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> a while and thou shalt see.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carter thwack’d his horses on the croup,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they began to drawen and to stoop.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Heit now,” quoth he; “there, Jesus Christ you bless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his handiwork, both more and less!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was well twight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> mine owen liart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> boy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray God save thy body, and Saint Loy!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now is my cart out of the slough, pardie.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lo, brother,” quoth the fiend, “what told I thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here may ye see, mine owen deare brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The churl spake one thing, but he thought another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us go forth abouten our voyage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here win I nothing upon this carriage.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When that they came somewhat out of the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour to his brother gan to rown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Brother,” quoth he, “here wons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> an old rebeck,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had almost as lief to lose her neck.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to give a penny of her good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will have twelvepence, though that she be wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I will summon her to our office;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, God wot, of her know I no vice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for thou canst not, as in this country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Winne thy cost, take here example of me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour clapped at the widow’s gate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Come out,” he said, “thou olde very trate;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow thou hast some friar or priest with thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who clappeth?” said this wife; “<i>benedicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God save you, Sir, what is your sweete will?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I have,” quoth he, “of summons here a bill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> pain of cursing, looke that thou be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To-morrow before our archdeacon’s knee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To answer to the court of certain things.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now Lord,” quoth she, “Christ Jesus, king of kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wis1y<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> helpe me, as I not may.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have been sick, and that full many a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not go so far,” quoth she, “nor ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I be dead, so pricketh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> it my side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May I not ask a libel, Sir Sompnour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And answer there by my procuratour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To such thing as men would appose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes,” quoth this Sompnour, “pay anon, let see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twelvepence to me, and I will thee acquit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall no profit have thereby but lit:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My master hath the profit and not I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come off, and let me ride hastily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give me twelvepence, I may no longer tarry.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Twelvepence!” quoth she; “now lady Sainte Mary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> help me out of care and sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wide world though that I should it win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No have I not twelvepence within my hold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye know full well that I am poor and old;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kithe your almes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> upon me poor wretch.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay then,” quoth he, “the foule fiend me fetch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I excuse thee, though thou should’st be spilt.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth she, “God wot, I have no guilt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Pay me,” quoth he, “or, by the sweet Saint Anne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I will bear away thy newe pan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For debte, which thou owest me of old⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that thou madest thine husband cuckold⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I paid at home for thy correction.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou liest,” quoth she, “by my salvation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never was I ere now, widow or wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Summon’d unto your court in all my life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor never I was but of my body true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the devil rough and black of hue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give I thy body and my pan also.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the devil heard her curse so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon her knees, he said in this mannere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Mabily, mine owen mother dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is this your will in earnest that ye say?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The devil,” quoth she, “so fetch him ere he dey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pan and all, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> he will him repent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, olde stoat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> that is not mine intent,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth this Sompnour, “for to repente me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any thing that I have had of thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would I had thy smock and every cloth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, brother,” quoth the devil, “be not wroth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy body and this pan be mine by right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt with me to helle yet tonight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where thou shalt knowen of our privity<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a master of divinity.”</span>

					<span>Body and soul, he with the devil went,</span>

					<span>Where as the Sompnours have their heritage;</span>

					<span>Mankinde, save and guide us all and some,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Had I had leisure for this Sompnour here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the text of Christ, and Paul, and John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of our other doctors many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such paines, that your heartes might agrise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
