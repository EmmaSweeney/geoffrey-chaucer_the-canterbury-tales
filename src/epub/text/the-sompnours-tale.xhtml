				<p>
					<span>The Sompnour in his stirrups high he stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this Friar his hearte was so wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like an aspen leaf he quoke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> for ire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lordings,” quoth he, “but one thing I desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I you beseech, that of your courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since ye have heard this false Friar lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As suffer me I may my tale tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Friar boasteth that he knoweth hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, God it wot, that is but little wonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Friars and fiends be but little asunder.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, pardie, ye have often time heard tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that a friar ravish’d was to hell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In spirit ones by a visioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as an angel led him up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shew him all the paines that there were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the place saw he not a frere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of other folk he saw enough in woe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the angel spake the friar tho;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Now, Sir,’ quoth he, ‘have friars such a grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none of them shall come into this place?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Yes’ quoth the angel; ‘many a millioun:’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto Satanas he led him down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘And now hath Satanas,’ said he, ‘a tail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Broader than of a carrack<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> is the sail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hold up thy tail, thou Satanas,’ quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Shew forth thine erse, and let the friar see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is the nest of friars in this place.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And less than half a furlong way of space,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so as bees swarmen out of a hive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the devil’s erse there gan to drive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A twenty thousand friars on a rout.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And throughout hell they swarmed all about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came again, as fast as they may gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his erse they creeped every one:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He clapt his tail again, and lay full still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This friar, when he looked had his fill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the torments of that sorry place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His spirit God restored of his grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into his body again, and he awoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless for feare yet he quoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was the devil’s erse aye in his mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is his heritage, of very kind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>God save you alle, save this cursed Frere;</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Lordings, there is in Yorkshire, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A marshy country called Holderness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which there went a limitour about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To preach, and eke to beg, it is no doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell that on a day this frere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had preached at a church in his mannere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And specially, above every thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Excited he the people in his preaching</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To trentals,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and to give, for Godde’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherewith men mighte holy houses make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as divine service is honour’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not there as it is wasted and devour’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor where it needeth not for to be given,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to possessioners,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> that may liven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thanked be God, in wealth and abundance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Trentals,” said he, “deliver from penance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their friendes’ soules, as well old as young,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, when that they be hastily y-sung⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for to hold a priest jolly and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He singeth not but one mass in a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Deliver out,” quoth he, “anon the souls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full hard it is, with flesh-hook or with owls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be y-clawed, or to burn or bake:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now speed you hastily, for Christe’s sake.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this friar had said all his intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With <i>qui cum patre</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> forth his way he went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When folk in church had giv’n him what them lest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went his way, no longer would he rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With scrip and tipped staff, y-tucked high:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every house he gan to pore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and pry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And begged meal and cheese, or elles corn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fellow had a staff tipped with horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pair of tables<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> all of ivory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a pointel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> y-polish’d fetisly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wrote alway the names, as he stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the folk that gave them any good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Askaunce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> that he woulde for them pray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Give us a bushel wheat, or malt, or rey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Godde’s kichel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> or a trip<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> of cheese,</span>

					<span>A Godde’s halfpenny, or a mass penny;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or give us of your brawn, if ye have any;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dagon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> of your blanket, leve dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our sister dear⁠—lo, here I write your name⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bacon or beef, or such thing as ye find.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sturdy harlot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> went them aye behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was their hoste’s man, and bare a sack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what men gave them, laid it on his back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he was out at door, anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He planed away the names every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he before had written in his tables:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He served them with nifles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> and with fables.⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, there thou liest, thou Sompnour,” quoth the Frere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Peace,” quoth our Host, “for Christe’s mother dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell forth thy tale, and spare it not at all.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So thrive I,” quoth this Sompnour, “so I shall.”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So long he went from house to house, till he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came to a house, where he was wont to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Refreshed more than in a hundred places</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sick lay the husband man, whose that the place is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bed-rid upon a couche low he lay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>Deus hic</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> quoth he; “O Thomas friend, good day,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said this friar, all courteously and soft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thomas,” quoth he, “God yield it you,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> full oft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have I upon this bench fared full well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here have I eaten many a merry meal.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the bench he drove away the cat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid adown his potent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and his hat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke his scrip, and sat himself adown:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fellow was y-walked into town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth with his knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> into that hostelry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> him that night to lie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O deare master,” quoth this sicke man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How have ye fared since that March began?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw you not this fortenight and more.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“God wot,” quoth he, “labour’d have I full sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And specially for thy salvation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have I said many a precious orison,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for mine other friendes, God them bless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have this day been at your church at mess,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said sermon after my simple wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not all after the text of Holy Writ;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it is hard to you, as I suppose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore will I teach you aye the glose.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glosing is a full glorious thing certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For letter slayeth, as we clerkes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There have I taught them to be charitable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spend their good where it is reasonable.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there I saw our dame; where is she?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yonder I trow that in the yard she be,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this man; “and she will come anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hey master, welcome be ye by Saint John,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this wife; “how fare ye heartily?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This friar riseth up full courteously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her embraceth in his armes narrow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And kiss’th her sweet, and chirketh as a sparrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his lippes: “Dame,” quoth he, “right well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he that is your servant every deal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thanked be God, that gave you soul and life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet saw I not this day so fair a wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the churche, God so save me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, God amend defaultes, Sir,” quoth she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Algates<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> welcome be ye, by my fay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>Grand mercy</i>, Dame; that have I found alway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of your greate goodness, by your leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I woulde pray you that ye not you grieve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will with Thomas speak a little throw:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These curates be so negligent and slow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To grope tenderly a conscience.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In shrift<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and preaching is my diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And study in Peter’s wordes and in Paul’s;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I walk and fishe Christian menne’s souls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To yield our Lord Jesus his proper rent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To spread his word is alle mine intent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now by your faith, O deare Sir,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Chide him right well, for sainte charity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is aye angry as is a pismire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he have all that he can desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I him wrie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> at night, and make him warm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ov’r him lay my leg and eke mine arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He groaneth as our boar that lies in sty:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Other disport of him right none have I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not please him in no manner case.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Thomas, je vous dis, Thomas, Thomas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This maketh the fiend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> this must be amended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ire is a thing that high God hath defended,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereof will I speak a word or two.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, master,” quoth the wife, “ere that I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What will ye dine? I will go thereabout.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Dame,” quoth he, “<i>je vous dis sans doute</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had I not of a capon but the liver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of your white bread not but a shiver,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that a roasted pigge’s head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But I would that for me no beast were dead,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then had I with you homely suffisance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a man of little sustenance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My spirit hath its fost’ring in the Bible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My body is aye so ready and penible<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> that my stomach is destroy’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you, Dame, that ye be not annoy’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I so friendly you my counsel shew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I would have told it but to few.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now, Sir,” quoth she, “but one word ere I go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My child is dead within these weeke’s two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon after that ye went out of this town.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“His death saw I by revelatioun,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said this friar, “at home in our dortour.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare well say, that less than half an hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mter his death, I saw him borne to bliss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mine vision, so God me wiss.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did our sexton, and our fermerere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That have been true friars fifty year⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They may now, God be thanked of his love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make their jubilee, and walk above.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up I rose, and all our convent eke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With many a teare trilling on my cheek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute noise or clattering of bells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Te Deum</i> was our song, and nothing else,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that to Christ I bade an orison,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thanking him of my revelation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, Sir and Dame, truste me right well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our orisons be more effectuel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more we see of Christe’s secret things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than borel folk,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> although that they be kings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We live in povert’, and in abstinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And borel folk in riches and dispence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of meat and drink, and in their foul delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We have this worlde’s lust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> all in despight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lazar and Dives lived diversely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And diverse guerdon hadde they thereby.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fat his soul, and keep his body lean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We fare as saith th’ apostle; cloth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> and food</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffice us, although they be not full good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cleanness and the fasting of us freres</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maketh that Christ accepteth our prayeres.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Moses forty days and forty night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fasted, ere that the high God full of might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spake with him in the mountain of Sinai:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With empty womb of fasting many a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Received he the lawe, that was writ</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Godde’s finger; and Eli,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> well ye wit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With highe God, that is our live’s leech,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fasted long, and was in contemplance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aaron, that had the temple in governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke the other priestes every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the temple when they shoulde gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To praye for the people, and do service,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They woulde drinken in no manner wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No drinke, which that might them drunken make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there in abstinence pray and wake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest that they died: take heed what I say⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> they be sober that for the people pray⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ware that, I say⁠—no more: for it sufficeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Lord Jesus, as Holy Writ deviseth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave us example of fasting and prayeres:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore we mendicants, we sely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> freres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be wedded to povert’ and continence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To charity, humbless, and abstinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To persecution for righteousness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To weeping, misericorde,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> and to cleanness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore may ye see that our prayeres</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I speak of us, we mendicants, we freres),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be to the highe God more acceptable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than youres, with your feastes at your table.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Paradise first, if I shall not lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was man out chased for his gluttony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chaste was man in Paradise certain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hark now, Thomas, what I shall thee sayn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have no text of it, as I suppose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I shall find it in a manner glose;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That specially our sweet Lord Jesus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spake this of friars, when he saide thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Blessed be they that poor in spirit be’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so forth all the gospel may ye see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether it be liker our profession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or theirs that swimmen in possession;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fy on their pomp, and on their gluttony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on their lewedness! I them defy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me thinketh they be like Jovinian,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fat as a whale, and walking as a swan;</span>

					<span>All vinolent as bottle in the spence;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their prayer is of full great reverence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they for soules say the Psalm of David,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, ‘Buf’ they say, <i>Cor meum eructavit</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>

					<span>Who follow Christe’s gospel and his lore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>

					<span>Workers of Godde’s word, not auditours?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>

					<span>Up springs into the air, right so prayeres</span>

					<span>Thomas, that jape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> it is not worth a mite;</span>

					<span>And give that convent four and twenty groats;</span>

					<span>Nay, nay, Thomas, it may no thing be so.</span>

					<span>Of building up of churches may ye find</span>

					<span>Ye lie here full of anger and of ire,</span>

					<span>Beware, my son, and hearken patiently,</span>

					<span>An irous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> man God send him little might.</span>

					<span>“Whilom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> there was an irous potestate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As saith Senec, that during his estate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a day out rode knightes two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as fortune would that it were so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one of them came home, the other not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon the knight before the judge is brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That saide thus; ‘Thou hast thy fellow slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which I doom thee to the death certain.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to another knight commanded he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Go, lead him to the death, I charge thee.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happened, as they went by the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the place where as he should dey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The knight came, which men weened<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> had been dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then thoughte they it was the beste rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lead them both unto the judge again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They saide, ‘Lord, the knight hath not y-slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fellow; here he standeth whole alive.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Ye shall be dead,’ quoth he, ‘so may I thrive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is to say, both one, and two, and three.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the firste knight right thus spake he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘I damned thee, thou must algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> be dead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou also must needes lose thine head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thou the cause art why thy fellow dieth.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the thirde knight right thus he sayeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Thou hast not done that I commanded thee.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he did do slay them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> alle three.</span>

					<span>Irous Cambyses was eke dronkelew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, a lord of his meinie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loved virtuous morality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said on a day betwixt them two right thus:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘A lord is lost, if he be vicious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>[An irous man is like a frantic beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which there is of wisdom none arrest;]<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drunkenness is eke a foul record</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of any man, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> of a lord.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is full many an eye and many an ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awaiting on<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> a lord, he knows not where.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s love, drink more attemperly:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wine maketh man to lose wretchedly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mind, and eke his limbes every one.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘The reverse shalt thou see,’ quoth he, ‘anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prove it by thine own experience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wine doth to folk no such offence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no wine bereaveth me my might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of hand, nor foot, nor of mine eyen sight.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for despite he dranke muche more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred part<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> than he had done before,</span>

					<span>And right anon this cursed irous wretch</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Commanding him he should before him stand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly he took his bow in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up the string he pulled to his ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with an arrow slew the child right there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Now whether have I a sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> hand or non?’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth he; ‘Is all my might and mind agone?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath wine bereaved me mine eyen sight?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I tell the answer of the knight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His son was slain, there is no more to say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware therefore with lordes how ye play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

					<span>On this condition, and other none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou depart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> it so, my deare brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every friar have as much as other:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This shalt thou swear on thy profession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute fraud or cavillation.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I swear it,” quoth the friar, “upon my faith.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal his hand in his he lay’th;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lo here my faith, in me shall be no lack.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Then put thine hand adown right by my back,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this man, “and grope well behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath my buttock, there thou shalt find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thing, that I have hid in privity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah,” thought this friar, “that shall go with me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down his hand he launched to the clift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hope for to finde there a gift.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this sicke man felte this frere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his taile groping there and here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid his hand he let the friar a fart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no capel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> drawing in a cart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That might have let a fart of such a soun’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The friar up start, as doth a wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> lioun:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, false churl,” quoth he, “for Godde’s bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This hast thou in despite done for the nones:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt abie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> this fart, if that I may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His meinie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> which that heard of this affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came leaping in, and chased out the frere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went with a full angry cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fetch’d his fellow, there as lay his store:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looked as it were a wilde boar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And grounde with his teeth, so was he wroth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sturdy pace down to the court he go’th,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as there wonn’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> a man of great honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom that he was always confessour:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This worthy man was lord of that village.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This friar came, as he were in a rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as this lord sat eating at his board:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> might the friar speak one word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at the last he saide, “God you see.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This lord gan look, and said, “<i>Ben’dicite!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? Friar John, what manner world is this?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see well that there something is amiss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye look as though the wood were full of thieves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sit down anon, and tell me what your grieve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it shall be amended, if I may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I have,” quoth he, “had a despite to-day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God yielde you,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> adown in your village,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in this world is none so poor a page,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That would not have abominatioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that I have received in your town:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet ne grieveth me nothing so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As that the olde churl, with lockes hoar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blasphemed hath our holy convent eke.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, master,” quoth this lord, “I you beseek”⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No master, Sir,” quoth he, “but servitour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I have had in schoole that honour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God liketh not, that men us Rabbi call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither in market, nor in your large hall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No force,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> quoth he; “but tell me all your grief.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir,” quoth this friar, “an odious mischief</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This day betid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> is to mine order and me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so <i>par consequence</i> to each degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of holy churche, God amend it soon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” quoth the lord, “ye know what is to doon:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distemp’r you not,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> ye be my confessour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be the salt of th’ earth, and the savour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s love your patience now hold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me your grief.” And he anon him told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have heard before, ye know well what.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady of the house aye stiller sat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she had hearde what the friar said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hey, Godde’s mother;” quoth she, “blissful maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there ought elles? tell me faithfully.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Madame,” quoth he, “how thinketh you thereby?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How thinketh me?” quoth she; “so God me speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, a churl hath done a churlish deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What should I say? God let him never the;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>

					<span>His sicke head is full of vanity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hold him in a manner phrenesy.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Madame,” quoth he, “by God, I shall not lie,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The lord sat still, as he were in a trance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his heart he rolled up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How had this churl imaginatioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shewe such a problem to the frere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never ere now heard I of such mattere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> the Devil put it in his mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all arsmetrik<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> shall there no man find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before this day, of such a question.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who shoulde make a demonstration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every man should have alike his part</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of the sound and savour of a fart?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O nice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> proude churl, I shrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> his face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Sires,” quoth the lord, “with harde grace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who ever heard of such a thing ere now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every man alike? tell me how.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is impossible, it may not be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hey nice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> churl, God let him never the.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rumbling of a fart, and every soun’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is but of air reverberatioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever wasteth lite and lite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no man can deemen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> by my fay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that it were departed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> equally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? lo, my churl, lo yet how shrewedly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto my confessour to-day he spake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hold him certain a demoniac.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now eat your meat, and let the churl go play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him go hang himself a devil way!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now stood the lorde’s squier at the board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That carv’d his meat, and hearde word by word</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all this thing, which that I have you said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My lord,” quoth he, “be ye not evil paid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>

					<span>I coulde telle, for a gowne-cloth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To you, Sir Friar, so that ye be not wrot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that this fart should even<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> dealed be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among your convent, if it liked thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell,” quoth the lord, “and thou shalt have anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gowne-cloth, by God and by Saint John.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My lord,” quoth he, “when that the weather is fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute wind, or perturbing of air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> bring a cart-wheel here into this hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But looke that it have its spokes all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twelve spokes hath a cart-wheel commonly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bring me then twelve friars, know ye why?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thirteen is a convent as I guess;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your confessor here, for his worthiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall perform up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> the number of his convent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shall they kneel adown by one assent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to each spoke’s end, in this mannere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full sadly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> lay his nose shall a frere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your noble confessor there, God him save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall hold his nose upright under the nave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shall this churl, with belly stiff and tought<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any tabour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> hither be y-brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set him on the wheel right of this cart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the nave, and make him let a fart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ye shall see, on peril of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By very proof that is demonstrative,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That equally the sound of it will wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke the stink, unto the spokes’ end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that this worthy man, your confessour’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Because he is a man of great honour),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall have the firste fruit, as reason is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The noble usage of friars yet it is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The worthy men of them shall first be served,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certainly he hath it well deserved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath to-day taught us so muche good</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With preaching in the pulpit where he stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may vouchesafe, I say for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had the firste smell of fartes three;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so would all his brethren hardily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He beareth him so fair and holily.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The lord, the lady, and each man, save the frere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide, that Jankin spake in this mattere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well as Euclid, or as Ptolemy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touching the churl, they said that subtilty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And high wit made him speaken as he spake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is no fool, nor no demoniac.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Jankin hath y-won a newe gown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My tale is done, we are almost at town.</span>
