				<h3 epub:type="title">The Prologue</h3>
				<p>
					<span>When ended was the life of Saint Cecile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere we had ridden fully five mile,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Boughton-under-Blee us gan o’ertake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man, that clothed was in clothes black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And underneath he wore a white surplice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hackenay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> which was all pomely-gris,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweated, that it wonder was to see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seem’d as he had pricked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> miles three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horse eke that his yeoman rode upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweated, that unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> might he gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the peytrel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> stood the foam full high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was of foam, as flecked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> as a pie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A maile twyfold<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> on his crupper lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed that he carried little array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All light for summer rode this worthy man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in my heart to wonder I began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What that he was, till that I understood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that his cloak was sewed to his hood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, when I had long advised<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I deemed him some Canon for to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hat hung at his back down by a lace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had ridden more than trot or pace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hadde pricked like as he were wood.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A clote-leaf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> he had laid under his hood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it was joye for to see him sweat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His forehead dropped as a stillatory<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were full of plantain or of paritory.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he was come, he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“God save,” quoth he, “this jolly company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fast have I pricked,” quoth he, “for your sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that I would you overtake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To riden in this merry company.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Yeoman was eke full of courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide, “Sirs, now in the morning tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of your hostelry I saw you ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And warned here my lord and sovereign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that to ride with you is full fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his disport; he loveth dalliance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Friend, for thy warning God give thee good chance,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said oure Host; “certain it woulde seem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy lord were wise, and so I may well deem;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is full jocund also, dare I lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can he aught tell a merry tale or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he gladden may this company?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Who, Sir? my lord? Yea, Sir, withoute lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> of mirth and eke of jollity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> enough; also, Sir, truste me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> ye him knew all so well as do I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye would wonder how well and craftily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coulde work, and that in sundry wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath take on him many a great emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which were full hard for any that is here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bring about, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> they of him it lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As homely as he rides amonges you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If ye him knew, it would be for your prow:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye woulde not forego his acquaintance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For muche good, I dare lay in balance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that I have in my possession.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is a man of high discretion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn you well, he is a passing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> man.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well,” quoth our Host, “I pray thee tell me than,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is he a clerk,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> or no? Tell what he is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, he is greater than a clerk, y-wis,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this Yeoman; “and, in wordes few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Host, of his craft somewhat I will you shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, my lord can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> such a subtlety</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But all his craft ye may not weet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And somewhat help I yet to his working),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the ground on which we be riding</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that we come to Canterbury town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could all cleane turnen up so down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pave it all of silver and of gold.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when this Yeoman had this tale told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto our Host, he said; “<i>Ben’dicite!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This thing is wonder marvellous to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that thy lord is of so high prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of which men should him reverence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his worship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> recketh he so lite;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His overest slop<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> it is not worth a mite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in effect to him, so may I go;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is all baudy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> and to-tore also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is of power better clothes to bey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that his deed accordeth with thy speech?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Telle me that, and that I thee beseech.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why?” quoth this Yeoman, “whereto ask ye me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God help me so, for he shall never the<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But I will not avowe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> that I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore keep it secret, I you pray);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is too wise, in faith, as I believe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thing that is overdone, it will not preve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aright, as clerkes say; it is a vice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore in that I hold him lewd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and nice.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when a man hath over great a wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft him happens to misusen it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So doth my lord, and that me grieveth sore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God it amend; I can say now no more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thereof no force,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> good Yeoman, “quoth our Host;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Since of the conning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> of thy lord, thou know’st,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell how he doth, I pray thee heartily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that be is so crafty and so sly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where dwelle ye, if it to telle be?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In the suburbes of a town,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lurking in hernes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and in lanes blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as these robbers and these thieves by kind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holde their privy fearful residence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they that dare not show their presence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fare we, if I shall say the soothe.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yet,” quoth our Hoste, “let me talke to thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why art thou so discolour’d of thy face?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Peter!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> quoth he, “God give it harde grace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am so us’d the hote fire to blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it hath changed my colour, I trow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am not wont in no mirror to pry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But swinke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> sore, and learn to multiply.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>We blunder<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> ever, and poren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> in the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for all that, we fail of our desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever we lack our conclusion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To muche folk we do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> illusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And borrow gold, be it a pound or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ten or twelve, or many summes mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make them weenen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> at the leaste way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of a pounde we can make tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet is it false; and aye we have good hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It for to do, and after it we grope:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that science is so far us beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may not, although we had it sworn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It overtake, it slides away so fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It will us make beggars at the last.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While this Yeoman was thus in his talking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Canon drew him near, and heard all thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which this Yeoman spake, for suspicion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of menne’s speech ever had this Canon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Cato saith, that he that guilty is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deemeth all things be spoken of him y-wis;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of that he gan so nigh to draw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his Yeoman, that he heard all his saw;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he said unto his Yeoman tho;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hold thou thy peace,and speak no wordes mo’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if thou do, thou shalt it dear abie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou slanderest me here in this company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke discoverest that thou shouldest hide.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea,” quoth our Host, “tell on, whatso betide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all his threatening reck not a mite.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In faith,” quoth he, “no more do I but lite.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this Canon saw it would not be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But his Yeoman would tell his privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fled away for very sorrow and shame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah!” quoth the Yeoman, “here shall rise a game;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that I can anon I will you tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since he is gone; the foule fiend him quell!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ne’er hereafter will I with him meet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For penny nor for pound, I you behete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He that me broughte first unto that game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that he die, sorrow have he and shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it is earnest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> to me, by my faith;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That feel I well, what so any man saith;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet for all my smart, and all my grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all my sorrow, labour, and mischief,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>

					<span>Now would to God my witte might suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tellen all that longeth to that art!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless yet will I telle part;</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">36</a></h3>
				<p>
					<span>With this Canon I dwelt have seven year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his science am I ne’er the near:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that I had I have lost thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, God wot, so have many more than I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where I was wont to be right fresh and gay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of clothing, and of other good array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may I wear an hose upon mine head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where my colour was both fresh and red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now is it wan, and of a leaden hue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Whoso it useth, sore shall he it rue);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of my swink<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> yet bleared is mine eye;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo what advantage is to multiply!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That sliding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> science hath me made so bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I have no good,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> where that ever I fare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet I am indebted so thereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gold, that I have borrow’d truely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, while I live, I shall it quite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> never;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let every man beware by me for ever.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What manner man that casteth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> him thereto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he continue, I hold his thrift y-do;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So help me God, thereby shall he not win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But empty his purse, and make his wittes thin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he, through his madness and folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath lost his owen good through jupartie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he exciteth other men thereto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lose their good as he himself hath do’.</span>

					<span>For unto shrewes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> joy it is and ease</span>

					<span>To have their fellows in pain and disease.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>

					<span>Our termes be so clergial and quaint.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Which that was made? and of the care and woe</span>

					<span>That we had in our matters subliming,</span>

					<span>And in amalgaming, and calcining</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of quicksilver, called mercury crude?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all our sleightes we can not conclude.</span>

					<span>To be relieved by him afterward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such supposing and hope is sharp and hard.</span>

					<span>I warn you well it is to seeken ever.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That future <i>temps</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> hath made men dissever,</span>

					<span>In trust thereof, from all that ever they had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet of that art they cannot waxe sad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For unto them it is a bitter sweet;</span>

					<span>So seemeth it; for had they but a sheet</span>

					<span>They would them sell, and spend it on this craft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cannot stint,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> until no thing be laft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And evermore, wherever that they gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may them knowe by smell of brimstone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the world they stinken as a goat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their savour is so rammish and so hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That though a man a mile from them be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The savour will infect him, truste me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, thus by smelling and threadbare array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that men list, this folk they knowe may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if a man will ask them privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why they be clothed so unthriftily,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They right anon will rownen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> in his ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sayen, if that they espied were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men would them slay, because of their science:</span>

				<p>
					<span>Pass over this; I go my tale unto.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that the pot be on the fire y-do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of metals, with a certain quantity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord them tempers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> and no man but he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Now he is gone, I dare say boldely);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as men say, he can do craftily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> I wot well he hath such a name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet full oft he runneth into blame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know ye how? full oft it happ’neth so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pot to-breaks, and farewell! all is go’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These metals be of so great violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our walles may not make them resistence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> they were wrought of lime and stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They pierce so, that through the wall they gon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some of them sink down into the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Thus have we lost by times many a pound),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some are scatter’d all the floor about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some leap into the roof withoute doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that the fiend not in our sight him show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trowe that he be with us, that shrew;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In helle, where that he is lord and sire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there no more woe, rancour, nor ire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that our pot is broke, as I have said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every man chides, and holds him evil apaid.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some said it was long on<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> the fire-making;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some saide nay, it was on the blowing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Then was I fear’d, for that was mine office);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Straw!” quoth the third, “ye be lewed and nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was not temper’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> as it ought to be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the fourthe, “stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and hearken me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because our fire was not y-made of beech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is the cause, and other none, so the’ch.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot tell whereon it was along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But well I wot great strife is us among.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What?” quoth my lord, “there is no more to do’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of these perils I will beware eftsoon.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am right sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> that the pot was crazed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>

					<span>As usage is, let sweep the floor as swithe;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pluck up your heartes and be glad and blithe.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The mullok<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> on a heap y-sweeped was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the floor y-cast a canevas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all this mullok in a sieve y-throw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sifted, and y-picked many a throw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>

					<span>We muste put our good in adventure;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>

					<span>A merchant, pardie, may not aye endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truste me well, in his prosperity:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes his good is drenched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> in the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes comes it safe unto the land.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Peace,” quoth my lord; “the next time I will fand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bring our craft all in another plight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And but I do, Sirs, let me have the wite;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was default in somewhat, well I wot.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another said, the fire was over hot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But be it hot or cold, I dare say this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we concluden evermore amiss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We fail alway of that which we would have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in our madness evermore we rave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when we be together every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every man seemeth a Solomon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all thing, which that shineth as the gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not gold, as I have heard it told;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor every apple that is fair at eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not good, what so men clap<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> or cry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so, lo, fareth it amonges us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He that the wisest seemeth, by Jesus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is most fool, when it cometh to the prefe;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he that seemeth truest, is a thief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall ye know, ere that I from you wend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By that I of my tale have made an end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There was a canon of religioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amonges us, would infect all a town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though it as great were as was Nineveh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rome, Alisandre,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> Troy, or other three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sleightes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> and his infinite falseness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There coulde no man writen, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he mighte live a thousand year;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all this world of falseness n’is<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> his peer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in his termes he will him so wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speak his wordes in so sly a kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he commune shall with any wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he will make him doat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> anon aright,</span>

					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> it a fiende be, as himself is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a man hath he beguil’d ere this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And will, if that he may live any while;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet men go and ride many a mile</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>And if you list to give me audience,</span>

					<span>This tale was not only told for you,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That amonges Christe’s apostles twelve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no traitor but Judas himselve;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then why should all the remenant have blame,</span>

					<span>If any Judas in your convent be,</span>

					<span>In London was a priest, an annualere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That therein dwelled hadde many a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which was so pleasant and so serviceable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the wife, where as he was at table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she would suffer him no thing to pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For board nor clothing, went he ne’er so gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spending silver had he right enow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereof no force;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> will proceed as now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And telle forth my tale of the canon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That brought this prieste to confusion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false canon came upon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the prieste’s chamber, where he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beseeching him to lend him a certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gold, and he would quit it him again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lend me a mark,” quoth he, “but dayes three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at my day I will it quite thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it so be that thou find me false,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another day hang me up by the halse.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This priest him took a mark, and that as swithe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this canon him thanked often sithe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took his leave, and wente forth his way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the thirde day brought his money;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the priest he took his gold again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereof this priest was wondrous glad and fain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes,” quoth he, “nothing annoyeth me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lend a man a noble, or two, or three,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>When he so true is of condition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in no wise he breake will his day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To such a man I never can say nay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What,” quoth this canon, “should I be untrue?</span>

					<span>Nay, that were thing y-fallen all of new!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

					<span>Believe this as sicker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> as your creed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God thank I, and in good time be it said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That there was never man yet evil apaid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For gold nor silver that he to me lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ever falsehood in mine heart I meant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Sir,” quoth he, “now of my privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since ye so goodly have been unto me,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That I will do a mas’try ere I go.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea,” quoth the priest; “yea, Sir, and will ye so?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mary! thereof I pray you heartily.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“At your commandement, Sir, truely,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth the canon, “and elles God forbid.”</span>

					<span>“Sir,” quoth the priest, “it shall be done, y-wis.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bade his servant fetche him this thing,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Out of his bosom, and shew’d to the priest.</span>

					<span>Y-made, either of chalk, either of glass,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>To blinden with<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> this priest; and bade him hie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>

					<span>“Grand mercy,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> quoth the priest, and was full glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And couch’d the coales as the canon bade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while he busy was, this fiendly wretch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false canon (the foule fiend him fetch),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of his bosom took a beechen coal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which full subtifly was made a hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therein put was of silver limaile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>An ounce, and stopped was withoute fail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hole with wax, to keep the limaile in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And understande, that this false gin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not made there, but it was made before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other thinges I shall tell you more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hereafterward, which that he with him brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he came there, him to beguile he thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so he did, ere that they went atwin;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he had turned him, could he not blin.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It doleth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> me, when that I of him speak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On his falsehood fain would I me awreak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I wist how, but he is here and there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is so variant,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> he abides nowhere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But take heed, Sirs, now for Godde’s love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took his coal, of which I spake above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his hand he bare it privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while the prieste couched busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coales, as I tolde you ere this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This canon saide, “Friend, ye do amiss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is not couched as it ought to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon I shall amenden it,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now let me meddle therewith but a while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of you have I pity, by Saint Gile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be right hot, I see well how ye sweat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have here a cloth, and wipe away the wet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while that the prieste wip’d his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This canon took his coal⁠—with sorry grace⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And layed it above on the midward</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the croslet, and blew well afterward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that the coals beganne fast to brenn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now give us drinke,” quoth this canon then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> all shall be well, I undertake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sitte we down, and let us merry make.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whenne that this canon’s beechen coal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was burnt, all the limaile out of the hole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the crosselet anon fell down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so it muste needes, by reasoun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since it above so even couched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thereof wist the priest no thing, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He deemed all the coals alike good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of the sleight he nothing understood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when this alchemister saw his time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rise up, Sir Priest,” quoth he, “and stand by me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for I wot well ingot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> have ye none;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, walke forth, and bring me a chalk stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will make it of the same shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is an ingot, if I may have hap.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bring eke with you a bowl, or else a pan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full of water, and ye shall well see than<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that our business shall hap and preve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, for ye shall have no misbelieve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor wrong conceit of me, in your absence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wille not be out of your presence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But go with you, and come with you again.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chamber-doore, shortly for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They opened and shut, and went their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth with them they carried the key;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came again without any delay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I tarry all the longe day?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took the chalk, and shap’d it in the wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of an ingot, as I shall you devise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, he took out of his owen sleeve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A teine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> of silver (evil may he cheve!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a>)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that ne was but a just ounce of weight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take heed now of his cursed sleight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shap’d his ingot, in length and in brede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this teine, withouten any drede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So slily, that the priest it not espied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his sleeve again he gan it hide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the fire he took up his mattere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in th’ ingot put it with merry cheer;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the water-vessel he it cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that him list, and bade the priest as fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look what there is; “Put in thine hand and grope;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There shalt thou finde silver, as I hope.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What, devil of helle! should it elles be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shaving of silver, silver is, pardie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He put his hand in, and took up a teine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silver fine; and glad in every vein</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was this priest, when he saw that it was so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Godde’s blessing, and his mother’s also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And alle hallows,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> have ye, Sir Canon!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide this priest, “and I their malison<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> ye vouchesafe to teache me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble craft and this subtility,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will be yours in all that ever I may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth the canon, “Yet will I make assay<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second time, that ye may take heed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be expert of this, and, in your need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another day assay in mine absence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This discipline, and this crafty science.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let take another ounce,” quoth he tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Of quicksilver, withoute wordes mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And do therewith as ye have done ere this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With that other, which that now silver is. “</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The priest him busied, all that e’er he can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do as this canon, this cursed man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commanded him, and fast he blew the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to come to th’ effect of his desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this canon right in the meanewhile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All ready was this priest eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> to beguile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>and, for a countenance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> in his hande bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An hollow sticke (take keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and beware);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ end of which an ounce and no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silver limaile put was, as before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was in his coal, and stopped with wax well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to keep in his limaile every deal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while this priest was in his business,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This canon with his sticke gan him dress<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him anon, and his powder cast in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he did erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> (the devil out of his skin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him turn, I pray to God, for his falsehead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was ever false in thought and deed),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his stick, above the crosselet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was ordained with that false get,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stirr’d the coales, till relente gan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wax against the fire, as every man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he a fool be, knows well it must need.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that in the sticke was out yede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the croslet hastily<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> it fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goode Sirs, what will ye bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> than well?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that this priest was thus beguil’d again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supposing naught but truthe, sooth to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was so glad, that I can not express</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In no mannere his mirth and his gladness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the canon he proffer’d eftsoon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Body and good. “Yea,” quoth the canon soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Though poor I be, crafty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> thou shalt me find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn thee well, yet is there more behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is any copper here within?” said he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, Sir,” the prieste said, “I trow there be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Elles go buy us some, and that as swithe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goode Sir, go forth thy way and hie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went his way, and with the copper came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this canon it in his handes name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of that copper weighed out an ounce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too simple is my tongue to pronounce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As minister of my wit, the doubleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this canon, root of all cursedness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He friendly seem’d to them that knew him not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was fiendly, both in work and thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It wearieth me to tell of his falseness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And natheless yet will I it express,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that intent men may beware thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for none other cause truely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He put this copper in the crosselet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the fire as swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> he hath it set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his working for to stoope low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he did erst,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> and all was but a jape;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as him list the priest he made his ape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward in the ingot he it cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the pan he put it at the last</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of water, and in he put his own hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his sleeve, as ye beforehand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearde me tell, he had a silver teine;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He silly took it out, this cursed heine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Unweeting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> this priest of his false craft),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the panne’s bottom he it laft.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the water rumbleth to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondrous privily took up also</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The copper teine (not knowing thilke priest),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hid it, and him hente<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> by the breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to him spake, and thus said in his game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Stoop now adown; by God, ye be to blame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helpe me now, as I did you whilere;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put in your hand, and looke what is there.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This priest took up this silver teine anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thenne said the canon, “Let us gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With these three teines which that we have wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To some goldsmith, and weet if they be aught:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, by my faith, I would not for my hood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> they were silver fine and good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that as swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> well proved shall it be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the goldsmith with these teines three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They went anon, and put them in assay<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fire and hammer; might no man say nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that they weren as they ought to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sotted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> priest, who gladder was than he?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never bird gladder against the day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor nightingale in the season of May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never none, that better list to sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor lady lustier in carolling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or for to speak of love and womanhead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To standen in grace of his lady dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than had this priest this crafte for to lear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the canon thus he spake and said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For love of God, that for us alle died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I may deserve it unto you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shall this receipt coste? tell me now.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By our Lady,” quoth this canon, “it is dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn you well, that, save I and a frere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Engleland there can no man it make.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No force,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> quoth he; “now, Sir, for Godde’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shall I pay? telle me, I you pray.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Y-wis,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> quoth he, “it is full dear, I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir, at one word, if that you list it have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall pay forty pound, so God me save;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And n’ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> the friendship that ye did ere this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me, ye shoulde paye more, y-wis.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This priest the sum of forty pound anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of nobles fet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> and took them every one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To this canon, for this ilke receipt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All his working was but fraud and deceit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir Priest,” he said, “I keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> to have no los<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of my craft, for I would it were kept close;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as ye love me, keep it secre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if men knewen all my subtlety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, they woulde have so great envy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me, because of my philosophy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should be dead, there were no other way.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“God it forbid,” quoth the priest, “what ye say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet had I lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> spenden all the good</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that I have (and elles were I wood),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that ye shoulde fall in such mischief.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For your good will, Sir, have ye right good prefe,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth the canon; “and farewell, grand mercy.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went his way, and never the priest him sey<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After that day; and when that this priest should</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maken assay, at such time as he would,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this receipt, farewell! it would not be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, thus bejaped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> and beguil’d was he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus made he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> his introduction</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bringe folk to their destruction.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Consider, Sirs, how that in each estate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixte men and gold there is debate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So farforth that unnethes is there none.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This multiplying blint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> so many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in good faith I trowe that it be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cause greatest of such scarcity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These philosophers speak so mistily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this craft, that men cannot come thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any wit that men have how-a-days.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They may well chatter, as do these jays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in their termes set their lust and pain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to their purpose shall they ne’er attain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man may lightly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> learn, if he have aught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To multiply, and bring his good to naught.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, such a lucre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> is in this lusty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A manne’s mirth it will turn all to grame,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And empty also great and heavy purses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make folke for to purchase curses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of them that have thereto their good y-lent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, fy for shame! they that have been brent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! can they not flee the fire’s heat?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye that it use, I rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> that ye it lete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest ye lose all; for better than never is late;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never to thrive, were too long a date.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though ye prowl aye, ye shall it never find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be as bold as is Bayard the blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That blunders forth, and peril casteth none;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is as bold to run against a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to go beside it in the way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fare ye that multiply, I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that your eyen cannot see aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look that your minde lacke not his sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though you look never so broad, and stare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall not win a mite on that chaffare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wasten all that ye may rape and renn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withdraw the fire, lest it too faste brenn;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meddle no more with that art, I mean;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if ye do, your thrift<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> is gone full clean.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right as swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> I will you telle here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What philosophers say in this mattere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo, thus saith Arnold of the newe town,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As his Rosary maketh mentioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saith right thus, withouten any lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“There may no man mercury mortify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> it be with his brother’s knowledging.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how that he, which firste said this thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of philosophers father was, Hermes;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saith, how that the dragon doubteless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He dieth not, but if that he be slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his brother. And this is for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the dragon, Mercury, and none other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He understood, and Brimstone by his brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That out of Sol and Luna were y-draw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And therefore,” said he, “take heed to my saw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let no man busy him this art to seech,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> that he th’intention and speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of philosophers understande can;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he do, he is a lewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this science and this conning,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is of the secret of secrets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> pardie.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Also there was a disciple of Plato,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on a time said his master to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As his book, Senior,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> will bear witness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was his demand in soothfastness:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell me the name of thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> privy stone.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Plato answer’d unto him anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Take the stone that Titanos men name.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Which is that?” quoth he. “Magnesia is the same,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saide Plato. “Yea, Sir, and is it thus?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is ignotum per ignotius.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is Magnesia, good Sir, I pray?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It is a water that is made, I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ elementes foure,” quoth Plato.</span>
					<br/>
