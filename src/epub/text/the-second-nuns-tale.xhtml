				<span>The minister and norice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> unto vices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that men call in English idleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The porter at the gate is of delices;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’eschew, and by her contrar’ her oppress⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is to say, by lawful business⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well oughte we to do our all intent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest that the fiend through idleness us hent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>

			<p>
				<span>For he, that with his thousand cordes sly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Continually us waiteth to beclap,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he may man in idleness espy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He can so lightly catch him in his trap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till that a man be hent right by the lappe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

				<span>He is not ware the fiend hath him in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well ought we work, and idleness withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And though men dreaded never for to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet see men well by reason, doubteless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That idleness is root of sluggardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which there cometh never good increase;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see that sloth them holdeth in a leas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

				<span>And, for to put us from such idleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cause is of so great confusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have here done my faithful business,</span>

				<span>After the Legend, in translation</span>

				<span>Thou with thy garland wrought of rose and lily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee mean I, maid and martyr, Saint Cecilie.</span>

				<span>Thou maid and mother, daughter of thy Son,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>In whom that God of bounte chose to won;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>

				<span>Assembled is in thee magnificence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With mercy, goodness, and with such pity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou, that art the sun of excellence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not only helpest them that pray to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But oftentime, of thy benignity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full freely, ere that men thine help beseech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou go’st before, and art their lives’ leech.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now help, thou meek and blissful faire maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me, flemed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> wretch, in this desert of gall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think on the woman Cananee that said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whelpes eat some of the crumbes all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from their Lorde’s table be y-fall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though that I, unworthy son of Eve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be sinful, yet accepte my believe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, for that faith is dead withoute werkes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For to worke give me wit and space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I be quit from thennes that most derk is;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>O thou, that art so fair and full of grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be thou mine advocate in that high place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where as withouten end is sung Osanne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou Christe’s mother, daughter dear of Anne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And of thy light my soul in prison light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That troubled is by the contagion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my body, and also by the weight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of earthly lust and false affection;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O hav’n of refuge, O salvation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of them that be in sorrow and distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now help, for to my work I will me dress.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet pray I you, that reade what I write,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me that I do no diligence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> story subtilly t’ indite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For both have I the wordes and sentence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him that at the sainte’s reverence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The story wrote, and follow her legend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pray you that you will my work amend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>First will I you the name of Saint Cecilie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expound, as men may in her story see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is to say in English, Heaven’s lily,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pure chasteness of virginity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, for she whiteness had of honesty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And green of conscience, and of good fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweete savour, Lilie was her name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or Cecilie is to say, the way of blind;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she example was by good teaching;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else Cecilie, as I written find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is joined by a manner conjoining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heaven and Lia,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> and herein figuring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven is set for thought of holiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lia for her lasting business.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cecilie may eke be said in this mannere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanting of blindness, for her greate light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sapience, and for her thewes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or elles, lo, this maiden’s name bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heaven and Leos comes, for which by right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men might her well the heaven of people call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Example of good and wise workes all;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Leos people<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> in English is to say;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And right as men may in the heaven see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun and moon, and starres every way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right so men ghostly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> in this maiden free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sawen of faith the magnanimity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke the clearness whole of sapience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sundry workes bright of excellence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And right so as these philosophers write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That heav’n is swift and round, and eke burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right so was faire Cecilie the white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full swift and busy in every good working,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And round and whole<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> in good persevering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And burning ever in charity full bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now have I you declared what she hight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This maiden bright Cecile, as her life saith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was come of Romans, and of noble kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from her cradle foster’d in the faith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Christ, and bare his Gospel in her mind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never ceased, as I written find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her prayere, and God to love and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beseeching him to keep her maidenhead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when this maiden should unto a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-wedded be, that was full young of age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that y-called was Valerian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And come was the day of marriage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, full devout and humble in her corage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under her robe of gold, that sat full fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had next her flesh y-clad her in an hair.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And while the organs made melody,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To God alone thus in her heart sang she;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Lord, my soul and eke my body gie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwemmed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> lest that I confounded be.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for his love that died upon the tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every second or third day she fast’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aye bidding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> in her orisons full fast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The night came, and to bedde must she gon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her husband, as it is the mannere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And privily she said to him anon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O sweet and well-beloved spouse dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a counsel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> ye will it hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that right fain I would unto you say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that ye swear ye will it not bewray.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian gan fast unto her swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for no case nor thing that mighte be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never should to none bewrayen her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then at erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> thus to him saide she;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have an angel which that loveth me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with great love, whether I wake or sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ready aye my body for to keep;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if that he may feelen, out of dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye me touch or love in villainy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He right anon will slay you with the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in your youthe thus ye shoulde die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if that ye in cleane love me gie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will you love as me, for your cleanness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shew to you his joy and his brightness.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian, corrected as God wo’ld,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answer’d again, “If I shall truste thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me that angel see, and him behold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if that it a very angel be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I do as thou hast prayed me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if thou love another man, forsooth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right with this sword then will I slay you both.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cecile answer’d anon right in this wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If that you list, the angel shall ye see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that ye trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> Of Christ, and you baptise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go forth to Via Appia,” quoth she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from this towne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> stands but miles three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the poore folkes that there dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say them right thus, as that I shall you tell,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tell them, that I, Cecile, you to them sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shewe you the good Urban the old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For secret needes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and for good intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when that ye Saint Urban have behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell him the wordes which I to you told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when that he hath purged you from sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then shall ye see that angel ere ye twin.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian is to the place gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, right as he was taught by her learning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found this holy old Urban anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the saintes’ burials louting;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he anon, withoute tarrying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did his message, and when that he it told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urban for joy his handes gan uphold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The teares from his eyen let he fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth he, “Sower of chaste counsel, herd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of us all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fruit of thilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> seed of chastity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou hast sown in Cecile, take to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, like a busy bee, withoute guile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee serveth aye thine owen thrall<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> Cicile,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For thilke spouse, that she took but now,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full like a fierce lion, she sendeth here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As meek as e’er was any lamb to owe.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that word anon there gan appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An old man, clad in white clothes clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That had a book with letters of gold in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gan before Valerian to stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian, as dead, fell down for dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he him saw; and he up hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a> him tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his book right thus he gan to read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“One Lord, one faith, one God withoute mo’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One Christendom, one Father of all also,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aboven all, and over all everywhere.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These wordes all with gold y-written were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When this was read, then said this olde man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Believ’st thou this or no? say yea or nay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I believe all this,” quoth Valerian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For soother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> thing than this, I dare well say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the Heaven no wight thinke may.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then vanish’d the old man, he wist not where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Pope Urban him christened right there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian went home, and found Cecilie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his chamber with an angel stand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This angel had of roses and of lily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> two, the which he bare in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And first to Cecile, as I understand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gave the one, and after gan he take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other to Valerian her make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With body clean, and with unwemmed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep aye well these corones two,” quoth he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From Paradise to you I have them brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever more shall they rotten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lose their sweet savour, truste me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever wight shall see them with his eye,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It were full hard by order for to sayn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How many wonders Jesus for them wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the last, to telle short and plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sergeants of the town of Rome them sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And them before Almach the Prefect brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which them apposed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> and knew all their intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to th’image of Jupiter them sent.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And said, “Whoso will not do sacrifice,</span>

				<span>Swap<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> off his head, this is my sentence here.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon these martyrs, that I you devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>One Maximus, that was an officere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the prefect’s, and his corniculere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>

				<span>Them hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> and when he forth the saintes lad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself he wept for pity that he had.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Maximus had heard the saintes lore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He got him of the tormentores leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And led them to his house withoute more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with their preaching, ere that it were eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They gonnen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> from the tormentors to reave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>

				<span>The false faith, to trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> in God alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cecilia came, when it was waxen night,</span>

				<span>With priestes, that them christen’d all in fere;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And afterward, when day was waxen light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cecile them said with a full steadfast cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now, Christe’s owen knightes lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and dear,</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Shall give it you, as ye have it deserved.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when this thing was said, as I devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men led them forth to do the sacrifice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when they were unto the place brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To telle shortly the conclusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would incense nor sacrifice right nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on their knees they sette them adown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With humble heart and sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> devotion,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Their soules wente to the King of grace.</span>

			<p>
				<span>This Maximus, that saw this thing betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With piteous teares told it anon right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he their soules saw to heaven glide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With angels, full of clearness and of light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Andt with his word converted many a wight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which Almachius did him to-beat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With whip of lead, till he his life gan lete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>

			<p>
				<span>Cecile him took, and buried him anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Tiburce and Valerian softely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within their burying-place, under the stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after this Almachius hastily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bade his ministers fetchen openly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cecile, so that she might in his presence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do sacrifice, and Jupiter incense.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But they, converted at her wise lore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wepte full sore, and gave full credence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto her word, and cried more and more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Christ, Godde’s Son, withoute difference,</span>

				<span>And alderfirst,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> lo, this was his asking;</span>

				<br/>
				<span>“I aske thee,” quoth he, “though it thee grieve,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Almach answer’d to that similitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of whence comes thine answering so rude?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of whence?” quoth she, when that she was freined,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of conscience, and of good faith unfeigned.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Almachius saide; “Takest thou no heed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my power?” and she him answer’d this;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your might,” quoth she, “full little is to dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every mortal manne’s power is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a bladder full of wind, y-wis;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

				<span>Almach answered, “Choose one of these two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do sacrifice, or Christendom renay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou may’st now escape by that way.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At which the holy blissful faire maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gan for to laugh, and to the judge said;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O judge, confused in thy nicety,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wouldest thou that I reny innocence?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make me a wicked wight,” quoth she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo, he dissimuleth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> here in audience;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He stareth and woodeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in his advertence.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom Almachius said, “Unsely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> wretch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowest thou not how far my might may stretch?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Have not our mighty princes to me given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea bothe power and eke authority</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make folk to dien or to liven?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why speakest thou so proudly then to me?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I speake not but steadfastly,” quoth she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not proudly, for I say, as for my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We hate deadly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> thilke vice of pride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, if thou dreade not a sooth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I shew all openly by right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou hast made a full great leasing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou say’st thy princes have thee given might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both for to slay and for to quick<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> a wight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that may’st not but only life bereave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast none other power nor no leave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But thou may’st say, thy princes have thee maked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Minister of death; for if thou speak of mo’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou liest; for thy power is full naked.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do away<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> thy boldness,” said Almachius tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And sacrifice to our gods, ere thou go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I recke not what wrong that thou me proffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I can suffer it as a philosopher.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But those wronges may I not endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou speak’st of our goddes here,” quoth he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cecile answer’d, “O nice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou saidest no word, since thou spake to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I knew not therewith thy nicety,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that thou wert in every manner wise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lewed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> officer, a vain justice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There lacketh nothing to thine outward eyen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou art blind; for thing that we see all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it is stone, that men may well espyen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ilke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> stone a god thou wilt it call.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> thee let thine hand upon it fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And taste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> it well, and stone thou shalt it find;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since that thou see’st not with thine eyen blind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It is a shame that the people shall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So scorne thee, and laugh at thy folly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For commonly men wot it well over all,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That mighty God is in his heaven high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these images, well may’st thou espy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thee nor to themselves may not profite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in effect they be not worth a mite.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These wordes and such others saide she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he wax’d wroth, and bade men should her lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home to her house; “And in her house,” quoth he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Burn her right in a bath, with flames red.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as he bade, right so was done the deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in a bath they gan her faste shetten,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And night and day great fire they under betten.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The longe night, and eke a day also,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all the fire, and eke the bathe’s heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sat all cold, and felt of it no woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It made her not one droppe for to sweat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in that bath her life she must lete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he, Almachius, with full wick’ intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slay her in the bath his sonde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> sent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three strokes in the neck he smote her tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tormentor,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> but for no manner chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He might not smite her faire neck in two:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for there was that time an ordinance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no man should do man such penance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fourthe stroke to smite, soft or sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This tormentor he durste do no more;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But half dead, with her necke carven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a> there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He let her lie, and on his way is went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Christian folk, which that about her were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sheetes have the blood full fair y-hent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three dayes lived she in this torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never ceased them the faith to teach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she had foster’d them, she gan to preach.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And them she gave her mebles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and her thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the Pope Urban betook<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> them tho;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “I aske this of heaven’s king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have respite three dayes and no mo’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To recommend to you, ere that I go,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Here of mine house perpetually a church.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saint Urban, with his deacons, privily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The body fetch’d, and buried it by night</span>
