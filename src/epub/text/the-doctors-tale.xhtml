				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
				<p>
					<span>There was, as telleth Titus Livius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A knight, that called was Virginius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full filled of honour and worthiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strong of friendes, and of great richess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knight one daughter hadde by his wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No children had he more in all his life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fair was this maid in excellent beauty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboven ev'ry wight that man may see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For nature had with sov'reign diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-formed her in so great excellence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As though she woulde say, "Lo, I, Nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus can I form and paint a creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that me list; who can me counterfeit?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pygmalion? not though he aye forge and beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or grave or painte: for I dare well sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Apelles, Zeuxis, shoulde work in vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Either to grave, or paint, or forge, or beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they presumed me to counterfeit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he that is the former principal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath made me his vicar-general</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To form and painten earthly creatures</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as me list, and all thing in my cure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the moone, that may wane and wax.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for my work right nothing will I ax;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord and I be full of one accord.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made her to the worship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> of my lord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So do I all mine other creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What colour that they have, or what figures."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus seemeth me that Nature woulde say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This maiden was of age twelve year and tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which that Nature hadde such delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For right as she can paint a lily white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And red a rose, right with such painture</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She painted had this noble creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere she was born, upon her limbes free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as by right such colours shoulde be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Phoebus dyed had her tresses great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to the streames<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> of his burned heat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that excellent was her beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand-fold more virtuous was she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her there lacked no condition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is to praise, as by discretion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well in ghost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> as body chaste was she:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which she flower'd in virginity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all humility and abstinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With alle temperance and patience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With measure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> eke of bearing and array.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Discreet she was in answering alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though she were wise as Pallas, dare I sayn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her faconde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> eke full womanly and plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No counterfeited termes hadde she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seeme wise; but after her degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She spake, and all her worde's more and less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sounding in virtue and in gentleness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shamefast she was in maiden's shamefastness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constant in heart, and ever in business<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To drive her out of idle sluggardy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bacchus had of her mouth right no mast'ry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wine and slothe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> do Venus increase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As men in fire will casten oil and grease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of her owen virtue, unconstrain'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She had herself full often sick y-feign'd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that she woulde flee the company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where likely was to treaten of folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is at feasts, at revels, and at dances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That be occasions of dalliances.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such thinges make children for to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too soone ripe and bold, as men may see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is full perilous, and hath been yore;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all too soone may she learne lore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of boldeness, when that she is a wife.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And ye mistresses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in your olde life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lordes' daughters have in governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take not of my wordes displeasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinke that ye be set in governings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of lordes' daughters only for two things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Either for ye have kept your honesty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else for ye have fallen in frailty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knowe well enough the olde dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have forsaken fully such meschance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For evermore; therefore, for Christe's sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To teach them virtue look that ye not slake.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thief of venison, that hath forlaft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lik'rousness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and all his olde craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can keep a forest best of any man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now keep them well, for if ye will ye can.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look well, that ye unto no vice assent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest ye be damned for your wick'<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whoso doth, a traitor is certain;</span>

					<span>And take keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of that I shall you sayn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of alle treason, sov'reign pestilence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is when a wight betrayeth innocence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye fathers, and ye mothers eke also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though ye have children, be it one or mo',</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yours is the charge of all their surveyance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that they be under your governance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware, that by example of your living,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or by your negligence in chastising,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they not perish for I dare well say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that they do, ye shall it dear abeye.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Suffice this example now as here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I must turn again to my mattere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This maid, of which I tell my tale express,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She kept herself, her needed no mistress;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in her living maidens mighte read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a book, ev'ry good word and deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That longeth to a maiden virtuous;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was so prudent and so bounteous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which the fame out sprang on every side</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of her beauty and her bounte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> wide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That through the land they praised her each one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loved virtue, save envy alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That sorry is of other manne's weal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And glad is of his sorrow and unheal—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Doctor maketh this descriptioun.—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This maiden on a day went in the town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward a temple, with her mother dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is of younge maidens the mannere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now was there then a justice in that town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That governor was of that regioun:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, this judge his eyen cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this maid, avising<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> her full fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she came forth by where this judge stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon his hearte changed and his mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was he caught with beauty of this maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to himself full privily he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"This maiden shall be mine for any man."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon the fiend into his hearte ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And taught him suddenly, that he by sleight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This maiden to his purpose winne might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certes, by no force, nor by no meed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him thought he was not able for to speed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was strong of friendes, and eke she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Confirmed was in such sov'reign bounte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That well he wist he might her never win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to make her with her body sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, with great deliberatioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sent after a clerk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> was in the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which he knew for subtle and for bold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This judge unto this clerk his tale told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In secret wise, and made him to assure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shoulde tell it to no creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he did, he shoulde lose his head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when assented was this cursed rede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glad was the judge, and made him greate cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave him giftes precious and dear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> was all their conspiracy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From point to point, how that his lechery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Performed shoulde be full subtilly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye shall hear it after openly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home went this clerk, that highte Claudius.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false judge, that highte Appius,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(So was his name, for it is no fable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But knowen for a storial<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> thing notable;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sentence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> of it sooth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> is out of doubt);—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false judge went now fast about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hasten his delight all that he may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, soon after on a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false judge, as telleth us the story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he was wont, sat in his consistory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave his doomes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> upon sundry case';</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This false clerk came forth a full great pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide; Lord, if that it be your will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As do me right upon this piteous bill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which I plain upon Virginius.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he will say it is not thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will it prove, and finde good witness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That sooth is what my bille will express."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The judge answer'd, "Of this, in his absence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not give definitive sentence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> him call, and I will gladly hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt have alle right, and no wrong here."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Virginius came to weet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> the judge's will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon was read this cursed bill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sentence of it was as ye shall hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"To you, my lord, Sir Appius so clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sheweth your poore servant Claudius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that a knight called Virginius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the law, against all equity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holdeth, express against the will of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My servant, which that is my thrall<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> by right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which from my house was stolen on a night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that she was full young; I will it preve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By witness, lord, so that it you not grieve;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is his daughter not, what so he say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore to you, my lord the judge, I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yield me my thrall, if that it be your will."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, this was all the sentence of the bill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virginius gan upon the clerk behold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hastily, ere he his tale told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And would have proved it, as should a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke by witnessing of many a wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all was false that said his adversary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cursed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> judge would no longer tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor hear a word more of Virginius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But gave his judgement, and saide thus:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"I deem<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> anon this clerk his servant have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt no longer in thy house her save.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, bring her forth, and put her in our ward</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clerk shall have his thrall: thus I award."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when this worthy knight, Virginius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through sentence of this justice Appius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Muste by force his deare daughter give</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the judge, in lechery to live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went him home, and sat him in his hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let anon his deare daughter call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with a face dead as ashes cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon her humble face he gan behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With father's pity sticking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a> through his heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> would he from his purpose not convert.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Daughter," quoth he, "Virginia by name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There be two wayes, either death or shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou must suffer,—alas that I was bore!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For never thou deservedest wherefore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dien with a sword or with a knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O deare daughter, ender of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom I have foster'd up with such pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou were ne'er out of my remembrance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O daughter, which that art my laste woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in this life my laste joy also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O gem of chastity, in patience</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take thou thy death, for this is my sentence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For love and not for hate thou must be dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My piteous hand must smiten off thine head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas, that ever Appius thee say!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus hath he falsely judged thee to-day."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told her all the case, as ye before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have heard; it needeth not to tell it more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"O mercy, deare father," quoth the maid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word she both her armes laid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his neck, as she was wont to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The teares burst out of her eyen two),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, "O goode father, shall I die?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there no grace? is there no remedy?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"No, certes, deare daughter mine," quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Then give me leisure, father mine, quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"My death for to complain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> a little space:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, pardie, Jephthah gave his daughter grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to complain, ere he her slew, alas!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, God it wot, nothing was her trespass,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for she ran her father first to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To welcome him with great solemnity."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word she fell a-swoon anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after, when her swooning was y-gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She rose up, and unto her father said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Blessed be God, that I shall die a maid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give me my death, ere that I have shame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do with your child your will, in Godde's name."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word she prayed him full oft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with his sword he woulde smite her soft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word, a-swoon again she fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her father, with full sorrowful heart and fell,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her head off smote, and by the top it hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the judge he went it to present,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he sat yet in doom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a> in consistory.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when the judge it saw, as saith the story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bade to take him, and to hang him fast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But right anon a thousand people in thrast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To save the knight, for ruth and for pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For knowen was the false iniquity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people anon had suspect<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> in this thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By manner of the clerke's challenging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it was by th'assent of Appius;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They wiste well that he was lecherous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which unto this Appius they gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast him in a prison right anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as he slew himself: and Claudius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That servant was unto this Appius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was doomed for to hang upon a tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that Virginius, of his pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So prayed for him, that he was exil'd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And elles certes had he been beguil'd;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The remenant were hanged, more and less,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were consenting to this cursedness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				</p>

					<span>Here men may see how sin hath his merite:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware, for no man knows how God will smite</span>

					<span>In no degree, nor in which manner wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The worm of conscience may agrise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> wicked life, though it so privy be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no man knows thereof, save God and he;</span>

					<span>Therefore I rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> you this counsel take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forsake sin, ere sinne you forsake.</span>
