					<span>“Ho!” quoth the Knight, “good sir, no more of this;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye have said is right enough, y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And muche more; for little heaviness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is right enough to muche folk, I guess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say for me, it is a great disease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as men have been in great wealth and ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hearen of their sudden fall, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the contrary is joy and great solas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when a man hath been in poor estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And climbeth up, and waxeth fortunate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there abideth in prosperity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such thing is gladsome, as it thinketh me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of such thing were goodly for to tell.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yea,” quoth our Hoste, “by Saint Paule’s bell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye say right sooth; this monk hath clapped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> loud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake how Fortune cover’d with a cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot not what, and als’ of a tragedy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right now ye heard: and pardie no remedy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is for to bewaile, nor complain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That that is done, and also it is pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have said, to hear of heaviness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Monk, no more of this, so God you bless;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your tale annoyeth all this company;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such talking is not worth a butterfly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For therein is there no sport nor game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, Sir Monke, Dan Piers by your name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you heart’ly, tell us somewhat else,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sickerly, n’ere clinking of your bells,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on your bridle hang on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By heaven’s king, that for us alle died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should ere this have fallen down for sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although the slough had been never so deep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then had your tale been all told in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certainly, as these clerkes sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as a man may have no audience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nought helpeth it to telle his sentence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well I wot the substance is in me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If anything shall well reported be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir, say somewhat of hunting,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> I you pray.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the Monk, “I have no lust to play;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let another tell, as I have told.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spake our Host with rude speech and bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said unto the Nunne’s Priest anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Come near, thou Priest, come hither, thou Sir John,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us such thing as may our heartes glade.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be blithe, although thou ride upon a jade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What though thine horse be bothe foul and lean?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he will serve thee, reck thou not a bean;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look that thine heart be merry evermo’.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yes, Host,” quoth he, “so may I ride or go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> I be merry, y-wis I will be blamed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon his tale he hath attamed;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he said unto us every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sweete priest, this goodly man, Sir John.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></h3>
				<p>
					<span>A poor widow, somedeal y-stept<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> in age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was whilom dwelling in a poor cottage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside a grove, standing in a dale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This widow, of which I telle you my tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since thilke day that she was last a wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In patience led a full simple life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For little was her chattel and her rent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By husbandry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> of such as God her sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She found<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> herself, and eke her daughters two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three large sowes had she, and no mo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three kine, and eke a sheep that highte Mall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full sooty was her bow’r,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> and eke her hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which she ate full many a slender meal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of poignant sauce knew she never a deal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No dainty morsel passed through her throat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her diet was accordant to her cote.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Repletion her made never sick;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attemper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> diet was all her physic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And exercise, and hearte’s suffisance.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The goute let her nothing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> for to dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor apoplexy shente<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> not her head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No wine drank she, neither white nor red:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her board was served most with white and black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Milk and brown bread, in which she found no lack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> bacon, and sometimes an egg or tway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was as it were a manner dey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A yard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> she had, enclosed all about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With stickes, and a drye ditch without,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which she had a cock, hight Chanticleer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the land of crowing n’as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> his peer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His voice was merrier than the merry orgon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On masse days that in the churches gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well sickerer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> was his crowing in his lodge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is a clock, or an abbay horloge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By nature he knew each ascension</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ equinoctial in thilke town;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when degrees fiftene were ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then crew he, that it might not be amended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His comb was redder than the fine coral,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Embattell’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a> as it were a castle wall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bill was black, and as the jet it shone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like azure were his legges and his tone;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His nailes whiter than the lily flow’r,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like the burnish’d gold was his colour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This gentle cock had in his governance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sev’n hennes, for to do all his pleasance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which were his sisters and his paramours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondrous like to him as of colours.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the fairest-hued in the throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was called Damoselle Partelote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Courteous she was, discreet, and debonair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And companiable,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> and bare herself so fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since the day that she sev’n night was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That truely she had the heart in hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Chanticleer, locked in every lith;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lov’d her so, that well was him therewith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But such a joy it was to hear them sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the brighte sunne gan to spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sweet accord, “My lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> is fare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a> in land.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, at that time, as I have understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beastes and birdes coulde speak and sing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell, that in a dawening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Chanticleer among his wives all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat on his perche, that was in the hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And next him sat this faire Partelote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Chanticleer gan groanen in his throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As man that in his dream is dretched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that Partelote thus heard him roar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was aghast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">33</a> and saide, “Hearte dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What aileth you to groan in this mannere?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be a very sleeper, fy for shame!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he answer’d and saide thus; “Madame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you that ye take it not agrief;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, me mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> I was in such mischief,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right now, that yet mine heart is sore affright’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now God,” quoth he, “my sweven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> read aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keep my body out of foul prisoun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me mette,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> how that I roamed up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within our yard, where as I saw a beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was like an hound, and would have made arrest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my body, and would have had me dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His colour was betwixt yellow and red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tipped was his tail, and both his ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With black, unlike the remnant of his hairs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His snout was small, with glowing eyen tway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet of his look almost for fear I dey;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This caused me my groaning, doubteless.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Away,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> quoth she, “fy on you, hearteless!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas!” quoth she, “for, by that God above!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now have ye lost my heart and all my love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot love a coward, by my faith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certes, what so any woman saith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all desiren, if it mighte be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have husbandes hardy, wise, and free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And secret, and no niggard nor no fool,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor him that is aghast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> of every tool,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor no avantour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> by that God above!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How durste ye for shame say to your love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That anything might make you afear’d?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have ye no manne’s heart, and have a beard?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! and can ye be aghast of swevenes?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing but vanity, God wot, in sweven is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swevens engender of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> repletions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And oft of fume, and of complexions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When humours be too abundant in a wight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes this dream, which ye have mette tonight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cometh of the great supefluity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of youre rede cholera,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> pardie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which causeth folk to dreaden in their dreams</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of arrows, and of fire with redde beams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of redde beastes, that they will them bite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of conteke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and of whelpes great and lite;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as the humour of melancholy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Causeth full many a man in sleep to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fear of bulles, or of beares blake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or elles that black devils will them take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of other humours could I tell also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That worke many a man in sleep much woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I will pass as lightly as I can.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Cato, which that was so wise a man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said he not thus, ‘Ne do no force of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> dreams,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, Sir,” quoth she, “when we fly from these beams,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Godde’s love, as take some laxatife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On peril of my soul, and of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I counsel you the best, I will not lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That both of choler, and melancholy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye purge you; and, for ye shall not tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though in this town is no apothecary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall myself two herbes teache you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall be for your health, and for your prow;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in our yard the herbes shall I find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which have of their property by kind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To purge you beneath, and eke above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sire, forget not this for Godde’s love;</span>

					<span>Ware that the sun, in his ascension,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You finde not replete of humours hot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it do, I dare well lay a groat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye shall have a fever tertiane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else an ague, that may be your bane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A day or two ye shall have digestives</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wormes, ere ye take your laxatives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of laurel, centaury,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> and fumeterere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>

					<span>Or else of elder-berry, that groweth there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of catapuce,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> or of the gaitre-berries,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or herb ivy growing in our yard, that merry is:</span>

					<span>Pick them right as they grow, and eat them in,</span>

					<span>Be merry, husband, for your father’s kin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dreade no dream; I can say you no more.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Madame,” quoth he, “grand mercy of your lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, as touching Dan Catoun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath of wisdom such a great renown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he bade no dreames for to dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, men may in olde bookes read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of many a man more of authority</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than ever Cato was, so may I the,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>

					<span>That all the reverse say of his sentence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have well founden by experience</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dreames be significations</span>

					<span>As well of joy, as tribulations</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That folk enduren in this life present.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There needeth make of this no argument;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The very preve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> sheweth it indeed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of the greatest authors that men read<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saith thus, that whilom two fellowes went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On pilgrimage in a full good intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happen’d so, they came into a town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where there was such a congregatioun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of people, and eke so strait of herbergage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they found not as much as one cottage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which they bothe might y-lodged be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore they musten of necessity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for that night, departe company;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them went to his hostelry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took his lodging as it woulde fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one of them was lodged in a stall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far in a yard, with oxen of the plough;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That other man was lodged well enow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was his aventure, or his fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That us governeth all, as in commune.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, that, long ere it were day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This man mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> in his bed, there: as he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that his fellow gan upon him call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, ‘Alas! for in an ox’s stall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This night shall I be murder’d, where I lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now help me, deare brother, or I die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In alle haste come to me,’ he said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This man out of his sleep for fear abraid;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when that he was wak’d out of his sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He turned him, and took of this no keep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought his dream was but a vanity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus twies in his sleeping dreamed he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the thirde time yet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> his fellaw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came, as he thought, and said, ‘I am now slaw;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold my bloody woundes, deep and wide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arise up early, in the morning, tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the west gate of the town,’ quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘A carte full of dung there shalt: thou see,</span>

					<span>In which my body is hid privily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do thilke cart arroste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> boldely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My gold caused my murder, sooth to sayn.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him every point how he was slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a full piteous face, and pale of hue.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And, truste well, his dream he found full true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For on the morrow, as soon as it was day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his fellowes inn he took his way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he came to this ox’s stall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his fellow he began to call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hostelere answered him anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide, ‘Sir, your fellow is y-gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as day he went out of the town.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This man gan fallen in suspicioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rememb’ring on his dreames that he mette,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went, no longer would he let,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the west gate of the town, and fand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dung cart, as it went for to dung land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was arrayed in the same wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have heard the deade man devise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with an hardy heart he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Vengeance and justice of this felony:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My fellow murder’d in this same night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in this cart he lies, gaping upright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cry out on the ministers,’ quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘That shoulde keep and rule this city;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Harow! alas! here lies my fellow slain.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What should I more unto this tale sayn?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people out start, and cast the cart to ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the middle of the dung they found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deade man, that murder’d was all new.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O blissful God! that art so good and true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how that thou bewray’st murder alway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murder will out, that see we day by day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murder is so wlatsom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> and abominable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To God, that is so just and reasonable,</span>

					<span>That he will not suffer it heled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though it abide a year, or two, or three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murder will out, this is my conclusioun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon, the ministers of the town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a> the carter, and so sore him pined,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>

					<span>And eke the hostelere so sore engined,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they beknew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> their wickedness anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And were hanged by the necke bone.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Here may ye see that dreames be to dread.</span>

					<span>If that the wind not hadde been contrary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made them in a city for to tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That stood full merry upon an haven side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But on a day, against the even-tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wind gan change, and blew right as them lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>

					<span>And caste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> them full early for to sail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to the one man fell a great marvail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one of them, in sleeping as he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> a wondrous dream, against the day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought a man stood by his bedde’s side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him commanded that he should abide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said him thus; ‘If thou to-morrow wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt be drown’d; my tale is at an end.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He woke, and told his follow what he mette,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed him his voyage for to let;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for that day, he pray’d him to abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fellow, that lay by his bedde’s side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan for to laugh, and scorned him full fast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘No dream,’ quoth he,’may so my heart aghast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Men dream all day of owles and of apes,</span>

					<span>And eke of many a maze<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> therewithal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men dream of thing that never was, nor shall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I see, that thou wilt here abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus forslothe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a> wilfully thy tide,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>And thus he took his leave, and went his way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, ere that he had half his course sail’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know not why, nor what mischance it ail’d,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That no man shoulde be too reckeless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dreames, for I say thee doubteless,</span>

					<span>That many a dream full sore is for to dread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, in the life of Saint Kenelm<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a> I read,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>A little ere he was murder’d on a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His murder in his vision he say.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His norice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> him expounded every deal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sweven, and bade him to keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> him well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For treason; but he was but seven years old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore little tale hath he told<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of any dream, so holy was his heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I hadde lever than my shirt</span>

					<span>That ye had read his legend, as have I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dame Partelote, I say you truely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Macrobius, that wrote the vision</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Afric’ of the worthy Scipion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Affirmeth dreames, and saith that they be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Warnings of thinges that men after see.</span>

					<span>And furthermore, I pray you looke well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the Old Testament, of Daniel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he held dreames any vanity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read eke of Joseph, and there shall ye see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether dreams be sometimes (I say not all)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Warnings of thinges that shall after fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look of Egypt the king, Dan Pharaoh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His baker and his buteler also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether they felte none effect<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> in dreams.</span>

					<span>Whoso will seek the acts of sundry remes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>May read of dreames many a wondrous thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo Croesus, which that was of Lydia king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mette he not that he sat upon a tree,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That day that Hector shoulde lose his life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She dreamed on the same night beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that the life of Hector should be lorn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thilke day he went into battaile;</span>

					<span>She warned him, but it might not avail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wente forth to fighte natheless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was y-slain anon of Achilles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thilke tale is all too long to tell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke it is nigh day, I may not dwell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shortly I say, as for conclusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I shall have of this avision</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adversity; and I say furthermore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I ne tell of laxatives no store,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>

					<span>Of one thing God hath sent me large<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> grace;</span>

					<span>For when I see the beauty of your face,</span>

					<span>Ye be so scarlet-hued about your eyen,</span>

					<span>That I defy both sweven and eke dream.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he flew down from the beam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it was day, and eke his hennes all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with a chuck he gan them for to call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had found a corn, lay in the yard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Royal he was, he was no more afear’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He feather’d Partelote twenty time,</span>

					<span>He looked as it were a grim lion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his toes he roamed up and down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He deigned not to set his feet to ground;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thus royal, as a prince is in his hall,</span>

					<span>Befell that Chanticleer in all his pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His seven wives walking him beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast up his eyen to the brighte sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the sign of Taurus had y-run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twenty degrees and one, and somewhat more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew by kind,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and by none other lore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>

					<span>That broughtest Troy all utterly to sorrow!</span>

					<span>O Chanticleer! accursed be the morrow</span>

					<span>That thou into thy yard flew from the beams;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wert full well y-warned by thy dreams</span>

					<span>That thilke day was perilous to thee.</span>

					<span>But what that God forewot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> must needes be,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But by necessity conditionel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not have to do of such mattere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My tale is of a cock, as ye may hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That took his counsel of his wife, with sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To walken in the yard upon the morrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he had mette the dream, as I you told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Womane’s counsels be full often cold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Womane’s counsel brought us first to woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made Adam from Paradise to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as he was full merry and well at case.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for I n’ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a> to whom I might displease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I counsel of women woulde blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pass over, for I said it in my game.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read authors, where they treat of such mattere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what they say of women ye may hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These be the cocke’s wordes, and not mine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can no harm of no woman divine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fair in the sand, to bathe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">23</a> her merrily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lies Partelote, and all her sisters by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the sun, and Chanticleer so free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang merrier than the mermaid in the sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Physiologus saith sickerly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that they singe well and merrily.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell that, as he cast his eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the wortes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a> on a butterfly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was ware of this fox that lay full low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing ne list him thenne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">26</a> for to crow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But cried anon “Cock! cock!” and up he start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As man that was affrayed in his heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For naturally a beast desireth flee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his contrary,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">27</a> if be may it see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he ne’er erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">28</a> had soon it with his eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Chanticleer, when he gan him espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would have fled, but that the fox anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said, “Gentle Sir, alas! why will ye gon?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be ye afraid of me that am your friend?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, certes, I were worse than any fiend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I to you would harm or villainy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am not come your counsel to espy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truely the cause of my coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was only for to hearken how ye sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For truely ye have as merry a steven,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any angel hath that is in heaven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therewith ye have of music more feeling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than had Boece, or any that can sing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord your father (God his soule bless)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke your mother of her gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have in mnine house been, to my great ease:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certes, Sir, full fain would I you please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for men speak of singing, I will say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So may I brooke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">31</a> well mine eyen tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save you, I hearde never man so sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As did your father in the morrowning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes it was of heart all that he sung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for to make his voice the more strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would so pain him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">32</a> that with both his eyen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He muste wink, so loud he woulde cryen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And standen on his tiptoes therewithal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stretche forth his necke long and small.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke he was of such discretion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That there was no man, in no region,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That him in song or wisdom mighte pass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have well read in Dan Burnel the Ass,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among his verse, how that there was a cock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a> a prieste’s son gave him a knock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his leg, while he was young and nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made him for to lose his benefice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But certain there is no comparison</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt the wisdom and discretion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of youre father, and his subtilty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now singe, Sir, for sainte charity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let see, can ye your father counterfeit?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Chanticleer his wings began to beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As man that could not his treason espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was he ravish’d with his flattery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! ye lordes, many a false flattour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is in your court, and many a losengeour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That please you well more, by my faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than he that soothfastness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a> unto you saith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read in Ecclesiast’ of flattery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware, ye lordes, of their treachery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stretching his neck, and held his eyen close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan to crowe loude for the nonce:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dan Russel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> the fox start up at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the gorge hente<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> Chanticleer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his back toward the wood him bare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet was there no man that him pursu’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O destiny, that may’st not be eschew’d!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas, his wife raughte<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> nought of dreams!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a Friday fell all this mischance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Venus, that art goddess of pleasance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that thy servant was this Chanticleer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in thy service did all his powere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More for delight, than the world to multiply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why wilt thou suffer him on thy day to die?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Gaufrid, deare master sovereign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, when thy worthy king Richard was slain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shot, complainedest his death so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why n’had I now thy sentence and thy lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Friday for to chiden, as did ye?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For on a Friday, soothly, slain was he),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would I shew you how that I could plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Chanticleere’s dread, and for his pain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Certes such cry nor lamentation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was ne’er of ladies made, when Ilion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was won, and Pyrrhus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a> with his straighte sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he had hent king Priam by the beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And slain him (as saith us Eneidos),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As maden all the hennes in the close,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they had seen of Chanticleer the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sov’reignly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a> Dame Partelote shright,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full louder than did Hasdrubale’s wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that her husband hadde lost his life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the Romans had y-burnt Carthage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was so full of torment and of rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wilfully into the fire she start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And burnt herselfe with a steadfast heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O woeful hennes! right so cried ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, when that Nero burned the city</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Rome, cried the senatores’ wives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that their husbands losten all their lives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoute guilt this Nero hath them slain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now will I turn unto my tale again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> widow, and her daughters two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearde these hennes cry and make woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the doors out started they anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw the fox toward the wood is gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bare upon his back the cock away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cried, “Out! harow! and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aha! the fox!” and after him they ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke with staves many another man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran Coll our dog, and Talbot, and Garland;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Malkin, with her distaff in her hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran cow and calf, and eke the very hogges</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fear’d they were for barking of the dogges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shouting of the men and women eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They ranne so, them thought their hearts would break.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They yelled as the fiendes do in hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The duckes cried as men would them quell;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The geese for feare flewen o’er the trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the hive came the swarm of bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So hideous was the noise, ben’dicite!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes he, Jacke Straw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">19</a> and his meinie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne made never shoutes half so shrill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that they woulden any Fleming kill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thilke day was made upon the fox.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of brass they broughte beames<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and of box,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of horn and bone, in which they blew and pooped,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal they shrieked and they hooped;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed as the heaven shoulde fall</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, goode men, I pray you hearken all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how Fortune turneth suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hope and pride eke of her enemy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cock, that lay upon the fox’s back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all his dread unto the fox he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saide, “Sir, if that I were as ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet would I say (as wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">3</a> God help me),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Turn ye again, ye proude churles all;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A very pestilence upon you fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now am I come unto the woode’s side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maugre your head, the cock shall here abide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will him eat, in faith, and that anon.’ ”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fox answer’d, “In faith it shall be done:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as he spake the word, all suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cock brake from his mouth deliverly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And high upon a tree he flew anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “O Chanticleer, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have,” quoth he, “y-done to you trespass,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inasmuch as I maked you afear’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I you hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">7</a> and brought out of your yard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sir, I did it in no wick’ intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come down, and I shall tell you what I meant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall say sooth to you, God help me so.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay then,” quoth he, “I shrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">8</a> us both the two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And first I shrew myself, both blood and bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou beguile me oftener than once.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt no more through thy flattery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">9</a> me to sing and winke with mine eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he that winketh when he shoulde see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All wilfully, God let him never the.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the fox; “but God give him mischance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is so indiscreet of governance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That jangleth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">11</a> when that he should hold his peace.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo, what it is for to be reckeless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And negligent, and trust on flattery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ye that holde this tale a folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of a fox, or of a cock or hen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take the morality thereof, good men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Saint Paul saith, That all that written is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To our doctrine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">12</a> it written is y-wis.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take the fruit, and let the chaff be still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now goode God, if that it be thy will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As saith my Lord,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">14</a> so make us all good men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bring us all to thy high bliss. Amen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sir Nunne’s Priest,” our hoste said anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Y-blessed be thy breech, and every stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was a merry tale of Chanticleer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by my truth, if thou wert seculere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wouldest be a treadefowl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">16</a> aright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if thou have courage as thou hast might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee were need of hennes, as I ween,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea more than seven times seventeen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See, whate brawnes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-n" id="noteref-n" epub:type="noteref">17</a> hath this gentle priest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So great a neck, and such a large breast</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With Brazil, nor with grain of Portugale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sir, faire fall you for your tale’.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after that, he with full merry cheer</span>
